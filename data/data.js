He may not have your skills, but he doesn’t care. That’s what he has the nuyen for—so he can buy yours. He’s corporate through and through, and you can’t ever forget that, because if you do, that’s when he sells you out for the good of his corp. But he’ll stay professional, of course, right up until the moment he slides the knife smoothly into your back. He’s useful, that Mr. Johnson, but every time you meet him, every time you have to deal with his double-crosses, his condescending put-downs, his smug superiority, you wish that the day would come when the tables were turned, when he was forced out on the street with nothing but his wits and street skills—whatever those might be—to keep him alive.\nWell, good news. Sometimes wishes come true, even in the Sixth World. Mr. Johnson is about to meet the street, and you’ve got a ringside seat.',

The security guard who lets a team into a top-secret facility because he thinks he’s pitching in on covert-ops training. The business suit who drops ten thousand nuyen on a project because he thinks it’ll earn him fifty thousand.\nMarks, all of them, and the Sixth World is full of them. Yeah, blasting your way into a well-guarded facility is fun, but talking your way in, smooth and subtle, might be more rewarding. Almost every kind of shadowrun involves at least a little con artistry, and some of them are full-on long cons. That means you need to sharpen your con game. With tips, plot updates, spells, gear, and more to improve characters’ con abilities, Cutting Aces gives players the swagger and skills they need to swindle the world. It also includes information on one of the Sixth World’s hottest spots for running a con—Istanbul, City of the World’s Desire.',

		description: 'There is no way to sugarcoat it—people in the Sixth World spend an awful lot of time coming up with reasons to kill each other. When it comes to moral codes, people don’t think they’re better than others because they don’t kill and others do—they compare the reasons for killing, ranking them, trying to justify the oft-unjustifiable. You can talk to a hundred people and get a hundred different opinions about what’s justified and what’s not, and about which motivations are worse than others, but consistently at the bottom of the list are those who would kill innocents for a cause, who would instill terror in people for political gain, because they see no other recourse.\n10 Terrorists covers ten groups in the Shadowrun setting who add chaos and violence to an already chaotic and violent world to further their own twisted causes. From Seed, a Matrix terrorism group that split off Ex Pacis, to Logos, a group that combines environmental extremism with talislegging, these are groups that can add and danger and plot hooks to Shadowrun campaigns. Whether runners are infiltrating the groups, avoiding them, or dealing with the fallout from the chaos they cause, 10 Terrorists can increase the threat level of any Shadowrun game.',

For shadowrunners, politics aren’t about debates and position papers—they’re about taking some of the money people are throwing around.\nDuring election season, when power is up for grabs, people are willing to do just about anything to get a piece of the pie. If you can help them get what they want, they’ve got a job for you. It may be peeking in the windows of the rich and famous. Or finding dirt on the opposition (or making some up). Or, if things get really desperate, ensuring the other guy doesn’t win because he’s too busy taking a dirt nap.\nHow much money you take in and how dirty your fingers get is up to you and your desire to not see the stars above you when you sleep.

When negotiations are complete, Ms. Johnson produces a photograph of a young girl, approximately age eleven, and a name: Catherine Westmore.\nThis little girl is the target.\nThe assignment is simple: Do some basic legwork to locate the target, determine the best circumstances in which to stage the extraction, retrieve the girl, and deliver her safely (and most importantly, unharmed) to a second team who will be awaiting her arrival at a safe house in the Aurora Warrens. Once the girl is safely delivered into the second team’s care, the remainder of the runners’ fees will be transferred into their accounts.\nThe runners will have to contend in some way with Jack “Frost” McPherson (a highly trained ex-marine who now works as Catherine’s personal bodyguard) and his friends who comprise the whole of local runner team The Trinity.\nOnce the runners have the target in hand, they will find themselves ambushed en route to the Aurora Warrens safehouse by The Trinity, attempting to get the girl back and help save their former comrade-inarms’ reputation and his career.\nWith the final obstacle neutralized, the runners can deliver the girl safely to the Aurora Warrens safehouse, after which they can go on about their business content that their rent is once again paid, and they don’t have to worry about missing any meals. The following morning they will get a rude awakening when they turn on their trids to discover that an innocent little girl by the name of Catherine Westmore died in a ransom drop gone wrong, when Lone Star officials failed to notice the sniper lurking on a nearby rooftop…\nMore humane runners may stop to consider, perhaps for the first time (perhaps not), just how strong an impact their lives can have--for better, or worse. Less humane runners may take a more cynical stance, facing the harsh truth that if they hadn’t done the job someone else would have, and they would instead be the ones falling behind on their bills.\nBut none of that will change the fact that their utilities won’t be cut off this month, their stomachs won’t growl, and a child is dead in the street; and there isn’t one damn thing they can do about it…\nYet.',

But, what if the defector is simply too valuable to the organization? They may know too much or hold a strategic position. The reasons don’t really matter. In the end, they can’t be released nor can they simply be killed. What then?\nThis is the position between the Koshari and Nathaniel Howlingcoyote, aka Alesandro Ibáñez. (see SRM02-14 Wetwork Pure and Simple for more of Nathaniel’s back story.)\nA few weeks ago, through various sources, the Koshari discovered Alesandro’s duplicity. While remaining on the surface at least, a loyal Koshari, he was secretly smuggling certain rare and esoteric materials into Denver through a company called XCR and, in turn, to the Vory. The Vory were moving the materials to a secret Tamanous hideout located underneath the Aurora Mall. They’d made a deal to supply the organleggers with chemicals and apparatus along with ‘raw materials’ for their operation. These chemicals were being used for fetus farming (see SRM02-21 Happenstance and SRM02-15 Critical Care).\nNormally, a Koshari underling found to be working with another crime organization would be loudly and publicly murdered along with any and all accomplices and left as a warning that such behavior would not be tolerated. But Alesandro was a special case. He was the majority shareholder of XCR and its current CEO. Killing him would deprive the Koshari of millions of nuyen, not to mention the inroads with Evo, and the company’s potential utility to the Koshari’s own smuggling operations. Since killing him was out of the question, the only answer left was to bring him back into the fold.\nThe easiest way to do this is to ensure that the Vory have reason for wanting him dead. Then Alesandro will have no choice but to return to the Koshari in the hopes that they will protect him. Since the Vory do not accept excuses nor do they forgive failure, this shouldn’t be too difficult. All it should take is a series of late, lost, or simply stolen deliveries.',

Finding Catherine’s killer requires all of the team’s ingenuity and resolve. Eventually, they find Takeshi Modori, former lover of Lady Jade and prime suspect in Catherine’s murder investigations hiding at Mystic Curiosities, a Talismonger\'s shop in CAS.  Takeshi tells them that he witnessed Catherine gunned down by her own father.\nTheir investigation resumes on the trail of Kazuya “The Dragon” Hotomi: an ex-Yakuza assassin. Kazuya has cut a deal with Lin Yao, a White Lotus Triad lieutenant for protection. To bring Kazuya to justice, the runners will have to deal with Lin Yao or infiltrate Klub Karma: a Triad controlled club in the heart of Chinatown. By doing so, they risk earning the enmity of the powerful organization.\nOnce Catherine’s killer is in their hands, they are to take him to an abandoned flophouse in the Aurora Warrens—the very spot where Catherine’s life ended. There, Ms. Johnson exacts her revenge either by using the runners to brutally torture Kazuya or, if the runners were involved in Catherine’s death, by betraying them and attempting to bring their lives to a fitting end.',

So when shadowrunners talk about “never trusting an elf,” that’s more of a bargaining position than anything else.\nLuckily for them, some elves have plenty of scratch they can use as a persuasive tool. And for the tasks they have in front of them, they’re going to need it. There’s money waiting for runners if they’re willing to venture into elven territory and take on a host of odd jobs. Jobs like: Tracking down reagents from cranky critters. Messing around in the affairs of Tír royalty. Dealing with a number of different punks and thugs, none of whom like you. And intervening in a leadership challenge of the most powerful elven street gang there is.\nElven Blood is a compilation of five different Missions that have been written to premiere at summer 2012 conventions. They can, however, be played by anyone. Whether you’re playing at a con, in a game store, or in the comfort of your own home, Elven Blood has an adventure for you. Taking you from the mean streets of Seattle to the wild lands of Tír Tairngire, Elven Blood offers exciting and inventive adventures for all Shadowrun fans.',

The Neutral Amish have many excellent craftsmen, and they build everything from commercial shipping pallets to fine furniture and wooden figurines. Simon Andrews was visiting this group to purchase miniatures for a game for one of Saeder-Krupp’s subsidiaries when a herd-gang of centaurs known as the Bronies (yeah, you read that correctly) attacked the Neutral Amish, demanding food, money, and handmade garments. The Bronies killed an Amish family and burned their farm to the ground in the attack. This should be viewed as an isolated act of violence, not an indictment of all who bear the name “brony.”\nThe Amish held a community benefit auction to raise money to hire shadowrunners to deal with the problem. Simon Andrews offered up his services as a fixer for them, free of charge, because Simon is a softy who loves hand-crafted furniture.\nOnce hired, the shadowrunners will go to NuerTagDorf and investigate. While the runners are investigating, the Bronies will return and kidnap one of the Amish girls on the other side of town. The team will locate the Bronies’ barn, only to find it empty save for a group of followers. From there they will return to the village to find an attack underway, as the Bronies are displeased with the lack of homemade garments, and think they need to teach the Neutral Amish that they are serious. There the final battle will take place. ',

For the first five years after Louis Senior’s death, no one could touch GameCon.

So far, Gilbertson and GameCon have been able to hold DarkestShadowCon at bay (barely) by keeping its numbers up. However, that hasn’t stopped DarkestShadowCon from engaging in a bit of sabotage augmented with numerous smear campaigns and flame wars on the Matrix. While their attendance numbers are higher than ever, GameCon has barely broken even monetarily over the last three years after dealing with DarkestShadowCon’s shenanigans.\nNow it seems DarkestShadowCon is poised to deliver a coup de grace.

Though most of those years were concurrent!\n\nAs BattleTech celebrates its 25th anniversary and Shadowrun celebrates its 20th, the visionaries at Catalyst Game Labs have, for the first time ever, brought these two worlds together! Join us in a universe that combines the best of two fantastic game universes in a tournament to decide who is the best warrior of all time!\n\nMany warriors have fallen, and only four remain in the Best Ever Tournament: Kieran McCool, the wily immortal elf who pilots the most feared \'Mech on the battlefield; Asmodeal el Angel de la Muerte, the Manei Domini blood mage who is so evil that his mere presence destroys all photons in the immediate vicinity; Nadja Daviar, a refugee from the 21st century who has lost none of her wiles or extreme sex appeal; and newcomer Jonas Hadry, a MechWarrior and battlefield commander so charismatic and beloved that it seems that possibly the deck was a little stacked in his favor.\n\nThe Best Ever is a bold venture that bridges two universes. Exciting, visionary, and often a bit deranged, this is the project that no one was asking for but everyone will love!\n\nContains a summary of the new Eighth World setting, nine new character archetypes, and a roleplaying adventure that involves your characters in the excitement, glamor and sheer ludicrousness of the Best Ever Tournament.\n\nThe Best Ever is kind of compatible with Shadowrun, 4th Edition, and A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG, elbow grease to make fully compatible not included.',

		description: 'We love riggers. We want them to have toys. But when we gathered the freelancers at the clubhouse (saltines are free, but bring your own beverage. And a chair), we quickly noticed that they were struggling to come up with ideas.\nThis puts us in a pinch. We thought we could try making our scary face at them to intimidate them into genius creativity, but we have been told in the past that our scary face looks like a mildly peeved newspaper delivery boy, so that wasn’t really going to get us anywhere. Besides, we like to offer carrots instead of sticks whenever possible. Though as we thought more about it, the whole concept of sticks seemed alluring. Maybe we could beat them into creativity!\nSo we set about them, making sure to work the torso and not leave any marks on their beautiful faces. After a while they started complaining that they’d really like to lie down for a while, so I broke out the sleeping bags and had them settle down on the clubhouse floor. I hoped that once they woke up, the genius would start flowing.\nAs you’ll see in these pages, our hopes were well and truly met—and then some. While this compilation may be slightly shorter than rigger books of past editions, we think you’ll agree that no rigger book in the history of Shadowrun has presented a series of vehicles and drones quite like this one. Only the right minds, treated the right way, could come up with the information this book contains. So it is with great pride that we present you: Rigger 4! Enjoy!',

		description: 'Work in Chicago long enough and you get used to a lot of weird things, so when one corp puts out the feelers for a team of runners to pull off a sabotage job on another, it seems refreshingly simple. It’s a classic shadowrun set up—two corps beat up on each other for a little while, runners make themselves a few nuyen, and the world keeps moving around.\nBut it’s not that simple. Of course it isn’t. If something of value is going through Chicago’s Containment Zones, people are going to catch its scent—and when they do, they’re going to want a piece of it. Runners are going to find themselves caught between multiple forces in the city, faced with the kind of choice that always seems extra difficult in the Sixth World: Figuring out what’s the right thing to do?',

Well, it’s Chicago’s Containment Zone, where a large group of people disappearing is not the strangest thing to happen this month. Or this week. Or today. But even if it’s not the strangest thing, it’s the one someone is willing to pay runners to investigate. So it’s important.\nThe thing is, a whole group of people doesn’t just disappear easily. Or nicely. Some of the powers that like to stay hidden in the Containment Zone are going to make themselves visible, and shadowrunners need to survive their appearance. And see if they can save some lives while they’re at it.',

They make it their business to know. That means that when you’re tracking down something with a lot of value, be cautious. You won’t be the only one after it.\nIn Lethal Forces, Mr. Johnson comes along spinning tales about secret research in a highly secure facility, which is definitely the sort of thing that has a lot of value. Mr. Johnson may not tell the runners who else might come calling, but what self-respecting team of runners relies on Mr. Johnson to give them the information they need? They’ll have to stay alert, keep their wits about them, and be ready for any and all opposition—including ones with scales.',

Sometimes, when it’s late, and you hear something that sounds like a scream echoing through dark alleys, you try to convince yourself that it was something else. An animal. An illusion. Anything but what it sounded like.\nBut it was a scream. You heard it, and you’ll hear it again, because in the Sixth World, the supply of terror is growing. Bug spirits work to devour corporations from within. Shedim claim dead bodies and mobilize to their own dark ends. And the hidden corners of the metaplanes and the Matrix contain creatures that are best not imagined, because to imagine them is to sever ties with reason.\nDark Terrors is a catalog of the horrors lurking under the surface of the Sixth World. With plot updates and hooks, critter stats, and campaign information presented in an immersive style, it’s an invaluable resource for players ready to stay on the edge of their seats. It is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition and Shadowrun: Anarchy.',

How about a rush job on a tight deadline, occasionally hostile crowds of locals, panicky security, explosions, stealth, open firefights in the streets, vicious traps, burning buildings, a crazed hermit, and a pack of drug-addicted dogs.\nThose are all ingredients in the stew that is this run, and Mr. Johnson is paying good money for you to wolf it down as fast as you can.

		description: 'The only shadowrunners who don’t ask the above question are ones who have been dead so long that no one remembers their name. Which, for most runners, means two months. The point being, any runner knows that a job that can be described in a simple, straightforward sentence at the beginning of the day is going to become a tumbled, tangled mess by the end of the day, the simple sentence exploding into a story that you’ll tell over a few drinks some night—unless the story got messy enough that you joined those forgotten shadowrunners in some shallow grave.\nThe simple sentence at the beginning of this job is this: “Retrieve a stolen cyberdeck prototype.” Sounds easy enough, but add “in Chicago’s Containment Zone” to the end of the sentence, and already the complications have begun to mount. And they’ll continue—by the time the runners are done, they’ll see double-crosses, deceits, lies, and betrayals speeding past them, and they’ll have to do their best to figure out what’s really going on before they get overwhelmed and overran.',

		description: 'Every runner knows there are times when you need to throw grenades at gasoline trucks, and other times when more discretion and subtlety is called for. True pros distinguish themselves with precise operations that are noticed by no one besides their target—but those targets see enough to push them over the edge of sanity.\nIn this Mission, runners get an assignment that is easy to describe but difficult to execute. The job? Ruin a life. The method? That’s where the runners come in. They’ll have to exercise all their creativity and sneakiness to plan and pull off this job—unless they want the police and some nasty corporate security putting their work to an early end. Do runners have the smarts, stealth, and deviousness to pull this off? As always, the answer is another question: How badly do they want to get paid?',

They’ll learn—fast, if they know what’s good for them.\nThe Complete Trog is the definitive guide for ork and troll characters in Shadowrun. With information on what it’s like to be an ork or troll in dozens of spots across the globe, details on working in corps as a trog (including in ork- and troll-dominated corps) and the heroes and enemies of trog culture, the book helps players add flavor and depth to their characters and the world around them. On top of that, it has gear, qualities, and life modules compatible with both Shadowrun, Fifth Edition and Shadowrun: Anarchy. Plunge into the rich culture of trogs and watch them turn that slur on its head.',

But upon his return to the Council, the tribe banishes him, saying the cyberware he’s accepted makes him unfit to be a shaman.

During one such run, they determine that Evo is retrieving an arcane artifact from a dig site located in Salish-Shidhe territory. Lucas convinces his team to take the initiative and either stop the dig or steal the artifact. But when a team member double-crosses Lucas and the others, he must race against time to discover the true masterminds behind this shadowrun…and stop the thief before they escape with both the artifact and Lucas’s last chance for redemption…',

It wasn’t exactly madness, but it sure felt like it.\nIt also made for some tough going for a time, and several lost jobs, but lately Vaquita’s gotten her swagger back. Her life may be a little trickier than the average runner’s, but she’s also got some skills she didn’t have before, not to mention new ways of bringing in the danger. And she has the perfect testing ground for her new abilities—the hulking, abandoned Angel Towers Arcology. Filled with squatters, gangs, vicious critters, and certain areas people only talk about in whispers, Angel Towers has enough danger and hidden caches of tech to keep a dozen teams of shadowrunners busy. And with her small, new team, Vaquita’s going to use it to not only rebuild her rep, but take it to the next level.\nBut the arcology’s secrets and dangers go far deeper than Vaquita realizes, and she’ll have to deal with the perils at every turn—as well as the people who put them there.',

		description: 'Shadowrun is an adaptation of the FASA tabletop role-playing game of the same name. The storyline of the video game is loosely based on the first Shadowrun novel, Never Deal with a Dragon, written by Robert N. Charrette.[4] The narrative opens in Seattle, Washington in the year 2050, where the protagonist Jake Armitage is shown being gunned down in the street. A shapeshifting vulpine figure rushes to his side and is seen casting a spell over Jake before leaving hastily as the medics arrive on the scene. Jake awakens in a morgue with a complete memory loss. Soon, he is approached by the "Dog", a shamanistic totem who gives him a warning before vanishing.\nThe rest of the story is spent investigating the events leading to Jake\'s shooting, learning the identity of the shapeshifter who saved him, as well the person who ordered his assassination, a mysterious crime lord named "Drake". Most of the information is found by piecing together snippets of data found by hacking various protected computer systems. Along the way, he has encounters with gangs, criminals, and magically awakened creatures while under constant threat of attack from contract killers. Jake also discovers and develops his own latent magical abilities. Apart from his totem spirit, his only allies are the hired services of shadowrunners. It is eventually revealed that Jake is a data courier who was carrying a program in a computer built inside his brain. The program was designed to destroy a malevolent artificial intelligence, which the Aneki Corporation is trying to protect. The company is being aided by Drake, who turns out to be a dragon and the mastermind behind the plot.',

		description: 'Shadowrun\'s story begins on January 31, 2058 in Seattle, United Canadian and American States. In the wilderness of the newly reclaimed Amerindian lands of the Salish-Shidhe, a small team of shadowrunners is brutally ambushed by unknown forces. The massacre is over quickly, but is captured in video by one of the slain member\'s cybereyes; the video is recovered and made national news. The last man to die in the video was a shadowrunner known as Michael, Joshua\'s brother.\nJoshua spends his last nuyen and flies to Seattle, vowing to avenge his brother\'s death. He arrives at Sea-Tac Airport and traces back Michael\'s last credstick transaction to "Stoker\'s Coffin Motel", in the Redmond Barrens. Joshua travels there to inquire about his brother, only to be told by the owner that Michael never paid his bill and in fact has some belongings being held. He strikes a deal with Joshua, and by beginning to do small shadowruns for a small-time Mr. Johnson, called Gunderson, he gains enough money to pay his brother\'s bills. In Michael\'s belongings, he finds three "holopix": one of a young woman, Tabatha Shale; of an Amerindian, David Owlfeather, and of Seattle General Hospital Dr. Heaversheen. There is also a low grade cyberdeck, along with a credstick containing 500 nuyen, which could have been used to pay off Michael\'s bill (the irony of this is one of the game\'s many humorous points).',

		description: 'According to the ancient Mayan calendar, magic is cyclical, leaving the world and returning every 5000 years. Magic enters the world, grows, peaks, and eventually retreats. When magic was last at its peak, a powerful Ziggurat was constructed near what would be modern day Santos, Brazil. The purpose of this construct is shrouded in the mists of history. Even the Chancela family, who secretly maintained the ziggurat for thousands of years, did not know its purpose. Nor did they know the purpose of the strange artifact somehow connected to the ziggurat. In the millennia since its construction the ziggurat was eventually buried, hidden in the side of a mountain. Then, on December 24, 2012, magic began returning to the world, leaving change and confusion in its wake.\nThe years after magic’s return wrought change on a global scale. RNA Global, a powerful multinational corporation, sent a research team to Santos, Brazil. Their job was to explore and research the strange energies coming from a mountainside along one edge of Santos. Armed with an artifact from ancient times, the research team sought to channel and control the magical energies they were exploring. Instead they caused a magical accident that destroyed half the city and brought down the mountainside, revealing the ziggurat to all. Deflecting blame for the incident to an Ork paramilitary organization, RNA retreated from the city while rethinking its strategy.\nAfter a time, RNA Global returned to Santos, this time armed with a government contract that provided them control over the city. Vowing to keep the peace and clean up Santos, RNA’s first actions were to enact martial law and declare a curfew for all citizens. The locals, still upset over the initial accident and trying to rebuild on their own, began resisting RNA’s efforts. The resistance was helped greatly by the leadership of the Chancela family who were dedicated to defending the ziggurat and recovering the artifact. Resistance turned to conflict, conflict turned to skirmish and skirmish eventually plunged the city into all-out war. Eventually, forces began to organize themselves under the Chancela family, and became known as "The Lineage".\nThe battle between these two sides has grown to great proportions as of 2031, as the struggle for the artifact continues between RNA Global forces and The Lineage.',

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall.

Neben Beschreibungen des Lifestyles, der Konzern- und Staatswelt, von Subkulturen, Magie und Matrix wird ein Fokus auf die drei Plexe Berlin, Hamburg und Rhein-Ruhr-Megaplex gelegt.

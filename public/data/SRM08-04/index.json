Ferocious gangers, hungry Infected, nefarious corp operativesâ€”they're just the starters. There's a full buffet of obstacles waiting for you, and Mr. Johnson is offering a nice sum of money to encourage you to chow down.\n\nThere's a critical piece of data squirreled away in a lost, offline server, and Mr. Johnson wants it retrieved. Doing so will require running a Containment Zone gauntlet, with an array of dangers that will test any running team. But if it wasn't hard, Mr. Johnson wouldn't be paying you to do it, would he?",

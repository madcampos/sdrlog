	"description": "## IT’S A WILD, WILD, WILD SIXTH WORLD…\n\nThere are a million stories in the dark, gritty world of Shadowrun, and this all-new volume brings sixteen of the best together for an in-depth look at this dark future of megacorps and the street warriors fighting against them.\n\nFeaturing established authors as well as brand-new voices, each tale is a vicious slice of life in the Sixth World. An injured street samurai whose call to DocWagon turns into the opportunity of a lifetime…if he can just live to collect it. A street-smart runner team confronts their most dangerous mission yet—hiding out in an isolated rural town. A corporate executive squares off against a ruthless vice-president in their own megacorp in a razor-sharp battle of wits and words. This collection also features stories about top runners such as Winterhawk, and a brand-new story featuring Wolf and Raven.\n\nFrom the highest floors of a megacorp’s global headquarters to the darkest streets of the dirtiest sprawl, every story here delivers that unique mix of magic, machines, and mayhem Shadowrun fans demand.\n\nFeaturing all new stories by:\n- Bryan CP Steele\n- R.

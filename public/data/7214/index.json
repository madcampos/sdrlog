	"description": "the Chaotic state of the UCAS!\n\nThe United Canadian and American States is in turmoil. In the past year, the great dragon Dunkelzahn won a special presidential election--and was assassinated on the night of his triumph. Savage riots broke out and have barely subsided; inexplicable magical phenomena have triggered a vicious anti-Awakened backlash; and corporate backstabbing and political intrigue are reaching new lows as everyone who can makes a play for the big time. And nowhere in the UCAS are the aftershocks as fierce as in three of its greatest cities: Boston, Detroit and Chicago.\n\nBoston, home of the East Cost Stock Exchange, has been neutral territory for years. But now Richard Villiers of Fuchi Corporation is rumored to be undertaking a secret operation there, and Boston's shadows are jumping.\n\nDetroit is the ulimate company town, home base of Ares Macrotechnology and Damien Knight's personal fiefdom. But all is not well in Aresville-Knight's ego is getting too big for his bottom line, and bad trouble is brewing.\n\nAnd Chicago, better known as Bug City, has finally been cured of the insect spirits that infested it ... or has it? And could the cure be worse than the disease?\n\nTarget: UCAS contains a wealth of information for players and gamemasters: adventure frameworks that allow gamemaster to jump right into these explosive cities, rules for ghoul player characters and free bug spirits, and more. Target: UCAS is intended for gamemasters and player of all experience levels. For use with Shadowrun and the Shadowrun Companion: Beyond the Shadows.",

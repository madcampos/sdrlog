	"description": "## INTO A DARK, DISTANT FUTURE…\n\nThe year 2084 may be decades away for us, but in the Sixth World, it’s now. However, the decades in between are filled with wild events: The Awakening. SURGE. The Night of Rage. The assassination of the dragon elected president, Dunkelzahn.\n\nThrough the Decades takes you from now to then, with seven original stories by grizzled veterans and brash newcomers to the shadows. Representatives of the newly established Native American Nations battle political skullduggery and assassins in their quest to form a more perfect union. Prime shadowrunner Ryan Mercury returns in a tale of his early days, and a love found, lost, and found again while running the shadows for Dunkelzahn. An exiled changeling returns home to try and pick up the pieces of his shattered life after the Year of the Comet. And legendary shadowrunners Wolf and Raven confront a bold new world—including dealing with their own children—as they get up to their usual tricks in today’s Sixth World.\n\nThese and three more new stories reveal glimpses of the Sixth World’s storied past…and provide the foundation for the future of the murky world that is _Shadowrun_.",

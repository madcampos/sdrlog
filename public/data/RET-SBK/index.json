	"description": "Seven and a half million people crammed into about 1,100 square kilometers. Nearly 6,800 people per square kilometer. Not the tightest-packed city in the world, at least not in terms of people, but still up there. But in terms of wealth, secrets, intrigue, and double-crosses? No place in the world is more densely packed. With seven and a half million people, you have seven and a half million personal agendas, and fifteen or twenty million schemes to get ahead in the world, because nobody has just one. Those plans run from the wealthiest corporations jockeying for politically and magically advantageous positions in the city to the poorest of the poor, fighting to avoid being devoured by the horrors that lurk in the Kowloon Walled City. Step into the sprawl and prepare to trip over conflicting agendas, spiraling plots, and secrets nested in secrets.",

	"description": "The runners are contacted via commlink by an Asian Ms. Johnson. She informs them that she wishes to hire them to perform a simple extraction. When negotiations are complete, Ms. Johnson produces a photograph of a young girl, approximately age eleven, and a name: Catherine Westmore.\nThis little girl is the target.\nThe assignment is simple: Do some basic legwork to locate the target, determine the best circumstances in which to stage the extraction, retrieve the girl, and deliver her safely (and most importantly, unharmed) to a second team who will be awaiting her arrival at a safe house in the Aurora Warrens. Once the girl is safely delivered into the second team's care, the remainder of the runners' fees will be transferred into their accounts.\nThe runners will have to contend in some way with Jack \"Frost\" McPherson (a highly trained ex-marine who now works as Catherine's personal bodyguard) and his friends who comprise the whole of local runner team The Trinity.\nOnce the runners have the target in hand, they will find themselves ambushed en route to the Aurora Warrens safehouse by The Trinity, attempting to get the girl back and help save their former comrade-inarms' reputation and his career.\nWith the final obstacle neutralized, the runners can deliver the girl safely to the Aurora Warrens safehouse, after which they can go on about their business content that their rent is once again paid, and they don't have to worry about missing any meals. The following morning they will get a rude awakening when they turn on their trids to discover that an innocent little girl by the name of Catherine Westmore died in a ransom drop gone wrong, when Lone Star officials failed to notice the sniper lurking on a nearby rooftop…\nMore humane runners may stop to consider, perhaps for the first time (perhaps not), just how strong an impact their lives can have--for better, or worse. Less humane runners may take a more cynical stance, facing the harsh truth that if they hadn't done the job someone else would have, and they would instead be the ones falling behind on their bills.\nBut none of that will change the fact that their utilities won't be cut off this month, their stomachs won't growl, and a child is dead in the street; and there isn't one damn thing they can do about it…\nYet.",

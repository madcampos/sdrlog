When things are turning sour who said mediators had to be neutral?\nA fixer hires the team for what seems like little more than a complicated prank. However, sometimes, people have a hard time keeping their vengeance proportionate. When two veterans of the business conflict enter the fray, the team needs to make some hard choices.

This 26-page scenario includes a complete adventure, player handouts, and record handling sheets for participating in the Shadowrun Missions (SRM) campaign.",

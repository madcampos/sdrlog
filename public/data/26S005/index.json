	"description": "Mob wars are ugly things, but not all ugliness is created equal. Things are going bad in Bangkok, and one Yakuza leader named Shinoda Yoshinori has been receiving a series of unsettling messages: bodies of other members of his gumi, packaged and delivered in a decidedly unique fashion. If Yoshinori wants to preserve his gumi—and save his life—he's going to have to take action. Due to the depleted manpower in his gumi, he's ready to turn to shadowrunners for help.\n99 Bottles introduces Shadowrun's new Enhanced Fiction line, in which short stories are accompanied by information and statistics that allows you to incorporate elements of the story into your game. In this book, the story kicks off a short adventure that is presented with all the information gamemasters and players need, from plot points to NPC stats to details of specific locations in the seething, energetic city of Bangkok. Let the new fiction set the stage for a plunge into one of the Sixth World's seamiest spots!",

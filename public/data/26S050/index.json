	"description": "When the Lights Go Down\n\nMoney? Check. Political turmoil leading to scrambling for power? You bet. Megacorps jockeying for position while working to take their rivals down a notch? Of course! A festering hive of corruption set next to one of the most scenic bays ever colonized by humans? Absolutely! San Francisco has all of the ingredients needed to make a nice, festering stew for shadowrunners. With the former imperialistic fascist General Saito out of power and the entire bay area united as a single sprawl, there is power and money to be had, which means business in the shadows is booming. San Francisco is a shadowrunner's guide to the people, places, and plots that make up this city, providing the paydata they need to navigate the hilly streets and cruel back roads of a sprawl whose aura of sophistication can't mask its deadly heart.",

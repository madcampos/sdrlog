Or would you?\nIt might be that some laws are... Misguided.\nIt's civil disobedience and a moral imperative to oppose those laws.\nGandhi taught us that.\nMy friends and Iâ€”we're here to help you make these difficult moral choices. We'll even provide you with a support network, if someone objects to your strong moral compass. And, hey, if everything works out, maybe all of us might come out ahead. Don't worry! We've got your back.",

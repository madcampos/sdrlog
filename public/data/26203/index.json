	"description": "Illegal is a strong word.\n\nIt means you're doing something that the government doesn't want you to do. You'd never do anything like that, right? Or would you?\nIt might be that some laws are... Misguided.\nIt's civil disobedience and a moral imperative to oppose those laws.\nGandhi taught us that.\nMy friends and I—we're here to help you make these difficult moral choices.

We've got your back.",

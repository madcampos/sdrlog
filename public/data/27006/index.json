	"description": "THE INFINITE FRONTIER\n\nThe last great undiscovered country is vast, wild, and weirder than you can possibly imagine. And it's nearby, waiting, accessible by the press of a button, or a simple gesture, or even just a thought. The Matrix holds a whole lot more than selfies and cat videosâ€”it has artificial intelligences, electronic ghosts of people formerly alive (or perhaps still living), and deep wells of pure data that can swallow you whole. Oh, and a copy of every secret ever recorded electronically. The possible rewards of exploration are great, and the dangers are greater.",

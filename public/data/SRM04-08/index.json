	"description": "A girl is missing. Finding her would be a nobler mission than most shadowrunners normally pursue, which means there must be a catch. And there is. The runners' job starts at a talismongers and then brings them to a Barrens orphanage. If they're observant enough, they'll be launched on a journey that will take them through dark tunnels, past dangerous entities, and, eventually, to a supposedly abandoned building that holds at least two dark secrets. If they're lucky, they'll find Ruth alive. If they're unlucky, they'll find her alive and transformed.",

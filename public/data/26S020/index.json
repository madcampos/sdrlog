	"description": "When you're a shadowrunner, you look for every ally you can get, any advantage you can grab. Which means that if the ground beneath your feet can either help you or hurt the other guy, you're going to find a way to make that happen.\nThe earth is full of magic. Mana lines wriggle and writhe in different locales, and strange elements bubble up from the core of the planet. Some areas boost magic to seemingly impossible heights, while others drain it away, sucking mana into nothingness. There are powers out there, just waiting for you to call onâ€”powers that may also be waiting to swallow you whole.",

	"description": "It used to be simple, right? When you went out into the wild, if you ran into something that didn't like you much, you mainly worked to steer clear of the business end of their claws and teeth. Maybe there were a few spitters or stingers out there, but not many, and a lot of them weren't too nasty. But that was then, before the Awakening.\nNow, there are critters out there that can mess with your mind, that can breathe fire, and that can freeze you with their gaze or hurt you with their scream. And you might come after them with fire, ice, or good, old-fashioned bullets, and they might shrug your attack right off. Maybe you think you can avoid themâ€”stay in the city and out of the wild. Nope, because in a lot of places, the city is the wild. The critters are there, and they're waiting for you.",

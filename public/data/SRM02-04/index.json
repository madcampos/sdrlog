	"description": "Mr. Johnson hires the runners to disrupt operations of a facility run by Rocky Mountain Dynamics (RMD), to \"encourage\" them to sell the property to his company. The runners are left to their own devices to determine how to harass RMD. As the tempo of their activities increase, the plant manager's connection to the Mafia may complicate the job for the runners. Although the runners are not told how many acts of harassment should occur, their actions will trigger the sale of the facility after two or three successful operations. Unfortunately, although RMD does sell the embattled facility, it is not to the buyer expected.",

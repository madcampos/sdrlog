	"description": "An item known as The Dragon Stone has been in circulation in the Denver shadows for a bit. While it started out in Yakuza control, the events of SRM02-08 Chasing the Dragon put it in the hands of a Triad lieutenant. During SRM02-24 Hubris and Humility, she lost the item. Now, there's a mad scramble in Denver's Underworld to recover the item. The team unwittingly finds that they have the rare artifact. The question that is raised is - to whom will they give it?\nThe various factions of Denver all want a piece of the action. However, Ghostwalker is interested as well. The team must decide the level of risk that they're willing to undertake to achieve their reward.",

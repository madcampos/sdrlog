	"description": "When the curtain goes up on a shadowrun in Chicago, you never know who's going to take the stage. There are all sorts of creepy players out there, ghouls and gangers and more, and once the overture's done, runners better be ready to dance with whoever emerges, with the rat-a-tat-tat of bullets keeping time.\nThe cast of characters in this mission includes a good-hearted street doc looking to expand, a pit-fighting elf, a pugnacious gang leader with an historical bent, and one of the oddest tribal gatherings ever seen inside a major sprawl. That's not all, of courseâ€”what would a good shadowrun be without a few surprise guests? Runners will have plenty to keep them on their toes, and hopefully by the end they'll have moved up a spot or two in the Chicago shadowrunner cast list. Assuming, of course, that they haven't dropped six feet under.",

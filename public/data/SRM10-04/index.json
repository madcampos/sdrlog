	"description": "## The Bullet of Shame\n\nThe beauty of Neo-Tokyo is, you don’t have to physically hurt someone to really damage them. The power of shame and social standing is so great that sometimes presenting the right facts in the right situation (or wrong situation, depending on your perspective) is enough to ruin someone. It requires more finesse than just filling a room with bullets, but isn’t that the mark of a good shadowrunner—delivering a blow without ever getting in the line of fire?\n\n_SRM 10-04 Get Bento is the latest in the Neo-Tokyo series of Missions, challenging the players to manipulate the social setting of the sprawl to achieve their goals. This can come with some chaos—the better the runners’ imaginations, the more chaos they can generate!_",

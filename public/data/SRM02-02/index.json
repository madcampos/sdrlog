	"description": "The runners are hired by Jaron Falcone, a retired fixer, to bring back Jonathan Belenkiy. They are working against the clock, as the ransom for Belenkiy is due in less than twenty four hours. Through investigation of his room, the runners find clues that lead them to the Black Cats. Legwork also turns up that Belenkiy hasn't been entirely clean with all of his dealings.\nAs the night goes on, the runners can meet with Sioux warriors and Mafia soldiers, on Belenkiy's trail. HammerJack will get nervous and approach them himself to try and have them turn against Falcone. If they are lucky, the runners will complete their mission without getting trapped in Ares' internal politics or being placed on the hit list of the Casquilho family.",

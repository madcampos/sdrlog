	"description": "VOTE EARLY! VOTE OFTEN!\nVOTE THE WAY THE TROLL WITH THE GUN WANTS YOU TO!\nSure, running against the corps is hard. But there's nothing in this world slimier, colder and deadlier than taking a run for some political slag. You're pawns, toys, nice at the mercy of a fat and nasty cat. They say never trust a dragon - I say never trust a politician.\nSuper Tuesday is a collection of five Shadowrun adventures set during the chaotic United Canadian and American States Election of 2057. From breaking into Bug City, to stopping a psycho toxic shaman on a death mission, to tangling with a secret society on a quest for a magical talisman, the player characters find out what it means when politicians enter the shadows.",

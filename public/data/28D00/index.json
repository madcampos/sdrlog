	"description": "# HOW MR. JOHNSON ROLLS!\n\nFor the first time, we are bringing to the Catalyst Store the same Executive Dice set originally offered as convention-only swag. One set of six dice, all precision-edged and crafted from aircraft-grade aluminum. In this Shadowrun set, the \"1\" is replaced with a troll skull, and the classic, totem \"S\" modifies the usual \"5\" and \"6\" faces.\n\nThis Executive set is anodized in color (black, blue, red, green, & purple) then laser-etched for a white face. There are six (6) dice in each set, and an optional case. The optional case is also aircraft-grade aluminum, precision-crafted in a sleek, channel-style form with strong magnetic clasps holding on the lid. The lid is laser-etched with the Shadowrun totem \"S\" logo.",

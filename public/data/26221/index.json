	"description": "THE CENTERS OF POWER\n\nThere is nothing in the sixth world more powerful than the megacorporations . Even great dragons scratch and claw to the power wielded by the Big Ten . If you're running the shadows , you'll need to know about the megas, because they'll deal with the biggest payday-and, if you cross them, the harshest paybacks.\n\nCorporate Guide helps runners learn what the ten AAA-rated corporations are up to in 2072 and answers questions such as: How is Aztechnology dealing with Amazonia these days? How is Horizon's continuing prominence affecting its laid-back culture? How many times can Richard Villiers have one mega rise from the ashes of another?\n\nCorporate Guide offers details on all of the Big Ten megacorporations and briefings on some of the rising powers of the corp world. It therefore provides the basics every shadowrunner should know about how corporations work and what life is like the drones trapped inside them, along with the rules for greater interaction of player characters with monoliths of power.",

	"description": "As any made-man can tell you, switching sides once you're in is just asking for a double-tap in the back of the head. But, what if the defector is simply too valuable to the organization? They may know too much or hold a strategic position. The reasons don't really matter. In the end, they can't be released nor can they simply be killed. What then?\nThis is the position between the Koshari and Nathaniel Howlingcoyote, aka Alesandro Ibáñez. (see SRM02-14 Wetwork Pure and Simple for more of Nathaniel's back story.)\nA few weeks ago, through various sources, the Koshari discovered Alesandro's duplicity. While remaining on the surface at least, a loyal Koshari, he was secretly smuggling certain rare and esoteric materials into Denver through a company called XCR and, in turn, to the Vory. The Vory were moving the materials to a secret Tamanous hideout located underneath the Aurora Mall. They'd made a deal to supply the organleggers with chemicals and apparatus along with 'raw materials' for their operation. These chemicals were being used for fetus farming (see SRM02-21 Happenstance and SRM02-15 Critical Care).\nNormally, a Koshari underling found to be working with another crime organization would be loudly and publicly murdered along with any and all accomplices and left as a warning that such behavior would not be tolerated. But Alesandro was a special case. He was the majority shareholder of XCR and its current CEO. Killing him would deprive the Koshari of millions of nuyen, not to mention the inroads with Evo, and the company's potential utility to the Koshari's own smuggling operations. Since killing him was out of the question, the only answer left was to bring him back into the fold.\nThe easiest way to do this is to ensure that the Vory have reason for wanting him dead. Then Alesandro will have no choice but to return to the Koshari in the hopes that they will protect him. Since the Vory do not accept excuses nor do they forgive failure, this shouldn't be too difficult. All it should take is a series of late, lost, or simply stolen deliveries.",

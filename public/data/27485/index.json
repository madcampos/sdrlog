	"description": "Elizabeth Nunn, a delightful woman who happens to have an odd habit of hanging out in hospitals and abandoned churches, has a grudge. A deep grudge. The kind of grudge that requires professional help to work out, and we're not talking about a psychotherapist. She needs shadowrunners, and if they're willing to take on the job, they'll encounter fierce gangers, wild critters, and members of a secret magical society who fiercely guard their mysteries. If the runners can survive, they can find out just what Nunn is mad aboutâ€”and how far she is willing to go for her revenge.",

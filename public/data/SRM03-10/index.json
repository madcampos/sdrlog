	"description": "Journalists have faced plenty of accusations of acting with a hive-mind mentality, but some covert operations in Manhattan are about to take things to a new level. What starts out for runners as a simple investigation into gang activities turns into an exploration of some of the city's darkest secretsâ€”the kind of things that tend to make anyone who finds out about them turn up dead. If the runners are going to survive this mission, they're going to have to fight hard, make tough decisions, and possibly join forces with some unusual allies.",

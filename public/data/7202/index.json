	"description": "Over thirty years ago, the violent formation of the Native American Nations shattered the United States of America and altered the geo-political boundaries of North America. Now, someone's setting out to prove that turn-about is not fair play and to bring about a little change of their own. Is it payback? Or something deeper? Regardless, it's a mad chase through the Native American Nations, full of the chaos one expects in a Shadowrun adventure.",

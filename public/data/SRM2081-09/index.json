	"description": "## No Rights for the Tenants\n\nWhen corporate giants set their site on an old piece of property, they don’t care how long the squatters have been there. So, instead, they hire deniable assets to come in and make sure that the trash gets taken to the curb.

And when you work the shadows, everyone seems to want a favor.",

	"description": "Grab Some Wheels and Ride\n\nIt's nice when you can spend the time and the money to pick the exact right vehicle to suit your needs, but time and money are two luxuries shadowrunners don't always have. Sometimes you need just two characteristics in a vehicle: It's cheap, and it moves.\nUsed Car Lotprovides an assortment of vehicles for Shadowrun so that runners can have plenty of options, from the practical, affordable Ford Americar to the ridiculously luxurious Rolls Royce Phaeton. Motorcycles, sports cars, limousines, and trucks, and moreâ€”they're all here. A lot of the vehicles here may not be state-of-the-art, but they'll get you from point A to point B, they may help you blend in with the rest of the populace, and they'll save you a few nuyen while you're at it. Because a good shadowrunner knows how to use fancy toys, but a great shadowrunner knows how to be awesome with simpler tools.",

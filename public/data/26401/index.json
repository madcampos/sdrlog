Some secrets reach into the ancient past, but they still have the power to shake the world. What they will do depends on whose hands they fall into...\nDusk was only the beginning. Jane \"Frosty\" Foster is back and ready to continue her artifact hunt. If they're game, runners will join her in a chase across North America, from the frozen, bug-filled wastes of Chicago to the political hotbed of Denver to the Deep Lacuna lurking under Los Angeles.",

	"description": "## ALWAYS READY TO ROCK…AND RUN!\n\nIt was supposed to be a Top Drek gig like any other: Play some tunes, have a fight, get wasted. How was I supposed to know the guy I cracked in two over a table was some corp bigwig? Like, not our usual crowd, y’know? (And look, I may be a bass player named Twinkle Toes, but I’m also a tall, red-skinned ork with a love for shouting, so there’s no way he didn’t see me coming.)\n\nSo the corp gave us a choice: Do a job for them, or die. How the frag can I say no? I got my bandmates to look out for, including my adopted daughter (and amazing singer), Ametheest, her maybe-lover Silver, my best mate, Bleeding Blossom, and our loser keyboardist, Lance.\n\nBut our spotlight is growing, dispelling the shadows we desperately need to hide in. Rock and roll might not jive with the corps…and Ottawa’s gonna get caught in the crossfire.\n\nIn the end, only one question remains for all of us, chummer: You gonna be SINless…or soulless?",

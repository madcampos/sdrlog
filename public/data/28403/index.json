	"description": "# ALL LINED UP\n\nYour eyes have to be everywhere. In front. In back. On the Matrix. On the astral. Threats come from every possible direction and dimension, and runners who don't keep an eye on every possible danger end up falling to the one they neglected.\n\nThe threats are lined up in Denver, a city ruled by a dragon and home to one of the greatest outlaw tech archives in the world. Shadows are aligning and plots are fomenting, and shadowrunners have the chance to learn what's happening in enough time to make some nuyen and save a few lives—including their own.",

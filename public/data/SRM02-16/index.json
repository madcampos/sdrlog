	"description": "When precious resources are in transit inside Denver, it's difficult for the various factions to stay idle. And when every faction has a reason to try to get hold of it, that leaves many decisions to the runners about their allegiance.\nIn this adventure, the runners are hired by the Casquilho mafia to retrieve two bioengineered animal specimens on display during an international scientific conference on wildlife preservation. The Yamato Yakuza clan is providing protection for the animals. These highly intelligent animals will follow the runners until their delivery. Between the retrieval and the delivery, other factions hear about that and make their offers to the runners to get the animals for themselves.",

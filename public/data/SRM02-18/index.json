	"description": "It's a bad day. The Frog Sorcerer (from ancient Pueblo legends) has come into power and has used it to cause a large mana storm. During the height of the storm, the Frog Sorcerer creates an astral rift and a Displacement Alchera (SM p.115) manifests, but he's not powerful enough to \"jump ship\" and become a free spirit, escaping the planes.\nMeanwhile, the runners find the worst luck following them just trying to get to a job downtown in this weather. When they finally get to the meet, they find Mr. Johnson dead, and no nuyen on him to compensate for the trip to the Hub.\nJust then, another opportunity shows up at the bar where they were to meet the late Mr. Johnson. Aaron Drey has been watching the storm anticipating something. When the Alchera opens, he recognizes the landscape. He believes that, through the alchera, the runners can locate the spirit Yuichotol for him. When the Runners get into the mountains of the Alchera, they unknowingly move through the rift into the metaplane of the ancient Pueblo.\nThe runners get off on the wrong foot as bad luck still lingers around them, but can obtain guidance in their search for Yuichotol. After battling mythical creatures and the Frog Sorcerer himself, the runners search comes up empty as Yuichotol has moved from this metaplane. However, the runners may recover a vessel for Yuichotol.\nAs the runners leave, they find that they've exited the metaplane at a different part of the alchera, and wind up in the office building across the street. They have to get out of that building, run back across the street, and present the skull to Aaron, who attempts to \"Reverse Engineer\" the spirit formula from the Construct in a creative Chaos style of magic.",

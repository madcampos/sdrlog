One day you're fighting Moroccan pirates on the docks of Lisbon, and the next you're hobnobbing with the academic elite of Prague. It's a friggin' maze of people and places, all acting like a big dysfunctional family. The Euro shadows are treacherous to navigate, but believe me, chum, the oportunities are umbelievable.\"",

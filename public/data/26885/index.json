But the one thing he is always there for is his friends. So when Toro, a ’runner from his merc days, gets jammed up with a death sentence in Texas, 8-ball does what he can to try and locate the other shadowrunners who double-crossed the troll and left him holding the bag.\n\nBut things are never what they seem in the shadows, and soon 8-ball is crisscrossing the globe in pursuit, always one step behind his elusive quarry. But as he edges closer and closer to his target, 8-ball uncovers a larger plot that if not stopped, could cause millions to die and possibly spark a war between a megacorporation and the UCAS…and all the while, the doomsday clock is counting down the hours until his friend is no more…\n\nAnd before it’s all over, 8-ball may have to make the worst choice of all…the life of one…against the lives of millions…",

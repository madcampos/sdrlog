	"description": "Lighting the Electric Town\n\nNeo-Tokyo, where the bright neon makes for some deep shadows. It's not the easiest place to navigate, but the rewards for learning how it works are high. Want a shot at the big time? Then you have to start somewhere. And there are always openings at the bottom.\n\nThat doesn't mean life will be either safe or boring. Dedicated runners can be caught in the mayhem of a troll metal concert, look for the right way to shake down a business, show some punks who's the boss, and give a corp drone what's coming to him. There may be bigger-paying jobs out there, but getting these jobs right is the first step to getting them.",

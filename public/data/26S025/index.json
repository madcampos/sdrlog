	"description": "Tír Tairngire Wants You!\n\nTír Tairngire has changed. The predominantly elven nation has an ork at its head, and the residents have become more welcoming to outsiders, in the sense that they don't always immediately threaten to shoot them when they come in sight.\nThere is enough wealth and power in Tír Tairngire to make even the slightest crack in the nation's façade tempting. Every shadowrunner knows that elves, especially powerful elves, do not rank high on the trustworthiness scale, but that doesn't have to be a deal breaker.\nAnticipating lies and betrayals from the people runners work with is part of the game. Runners should just be sure to gather critical information about getting in to the Tír, the major cities, and the dominant personalities before they go in, since forewarned is forearmed.",

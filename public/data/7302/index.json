	"description": "A blast of light punches my eyes as I walk down the ramp from street level. The dance floor is an amorphous beast, writhing with a thousand limbs, and the beat of the music red-lines my pulse into overdrive. On the stage, a nova is dancing.\nSearing beams of the spotlights catch the mirror-bright metal arms, legs, and face, reflecting them back in a dazzling cascade of color and light. The next thing you see is the hair flaring golden in the glare, surrounding her face like a solar corona around a silver moon. While Maria Mercurial dances, nothing else matters.\nOf course, something else does matter - biz. That's why you're here, chummier, to protect the silver lady with no past. The money's good, the job's easy; what could go wrong? Except maybe the lady's past is catching up with her.",

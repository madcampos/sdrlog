	"description": "Death Comes For Us All\n\nIn the Sixth World, death is fact of life. Some meet it way too soon, while others avoid it for way too long. And only a lucky few manage to go peacefully when their time does come. Regardless of when one is supposed to meet their maker, there are those in the shadows who are experts in arranging that meeting. Their methods may range from brutal and loud, to the silent and efficient. But no matter the method; death and those who deal it are never far away.",

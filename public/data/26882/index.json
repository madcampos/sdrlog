When they get an offer of a job retrieving a prisoner from an abandoned military base, the money offered by the megacorp is too good to pass up, despite the potential risks of infiltrating a former military base.\n\nSoon, they’re off to the island of Borinquen, in the Caribbean Ocean. But when their intel proves faulty, they realize that the base wasn’t a former prison, but a research facility.

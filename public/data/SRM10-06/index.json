	"description": "## The Ultimate Escape\n\nGetting out from under the thumb of the megacorps isn’t easy, but sometimes the circumstances are bad enough that people will do anything to make it happen. Twenty-year-old aidoru star Asada Yui wants to get out of the grind of being in the spotlight, but her corporate masters don’t want to let her go. She’s willing to do a lot to gain her freedom, including hiring runners to help her out. Shadowrunners need to be especially creative to help her reach her goal—and to keep themselves out of serious trouble.\n\n_SRM 10-06 The No Body Problem is dual-statted for use with both Shadowrun, Sixth World and Shadowrun, Fifth Edition._",

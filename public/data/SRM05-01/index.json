	"description": "It's been nearly twenty years since disaster struck the city of Chicago, transforming it into an urban hellscape, and some people now believe it's suffered enough. The Governor of Illinois has initiated and ambitious plan called Project: Takeback to reclaim the feral urban jungle. What's more, he's put money into the effort, and that's the language every corporation on Earth understands. Suddenly, the race is on as the megacorps scramble to claim pieces of the Windy City. They'll be butting up against the dangers of the Containment Zone and each other, so they're going to need all sorts of deniable assets. The shadows of Chicago are coming back to life.",

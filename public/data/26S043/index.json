	"description": "The Minefield of Opportunity\n\nThe number of ways you can step wrong in Cheyenne are higher than a lot of shadowrunners can count. There are political, ethnic, tribal, and racial divides, and stepping on the wrong side of them can not only end your job prospects, but it can put you in a hastily dug hole in the ground. Move quickly and be agile, though, and you can slip through the snares that trip up lesser runners, accumulating the street rep and nuyen that will put you at the top of the runner heap.",

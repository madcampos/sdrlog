	"description": "Jimmy Kincaid, burned-out mage and P. I., has a lot on his plate. Gang wars, feuding mobsters, unreliable magical power, and an encrypted data file that's already cost him friends, but he can't even access. When the troubles of the Seattle sprawl deepen into a bloody conspiracy with ties to neighboring nations and inhuman powers, he knows he's on the job of his life. Luckily, he's not alone. A man like Jimmy can't walk these shadowed streets without making enemies, but he's made allies, too.\nHopefully those allies will be able to save Jimmy from the dark, powerful forces converging on him...before it's too late for everyone...",

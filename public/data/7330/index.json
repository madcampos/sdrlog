	"description": "You're a shadowrunner, not some corporate lackey. No 9-to-5 shackles or power-tie chains for you. Every time you take on a run, you sign up to be used and abused. But you've got the smarts to come out on top.\nCorporate Punishment consists of three adventures in which the runners serve as pawns in a brutal corporate power struggle. They use their wits and weapons to take what the corps throw at them and survive with a smile—because the alternative is to hang up their Uzis and get a day job.",

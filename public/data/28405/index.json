	"description": "## C’est La Guerre\n\n“Paris is not a city; it’s a world.”\n\nThe vastness of Paris beckons. A world of plots, schemes, money, power, and beauty. A world shadowrunners could get lost in—permanently, if they’re not careful.\n\nWith alliances shifting and plots forming in the most elite parts of the city, Paris is a hotbed of shadow action. Final Bets gives players a chance to show that they can handle it—and maybe shape the fate of the world.",

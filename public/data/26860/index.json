	"description": "Someone - or something - is killing nightclub entertainers in Kings Cross, Australia. Striking from the shadows, methodical and heinous, the murderer has wrapped the bawdy, colorful neighborhood in a suffocating blanket of terror.\nNinniniru \"Ninn\" Tossinn, a troubled private investigator on the run from her past, joins forces with Barega, an elderly Aborigine shaman, to uncover the truth behind the malevolent force - and put themselves on the Cross Slayer's list. But can they defeat the darkness, survive Sydney's powerful mana storm, and reach the true heart of the evil threatening the city? Their search takes them from gritty alleys filled with gang symbols and worse to beneath the squatter-filled harbor bridge over shark-infested waters.\nAs their investigation deepens, soon the Cross Slayer isn't the only foe stalking them. Ninn and Barega have to put all their trust in each other if they're going to bring the slayer to justice, uncover the conspiracy behind the murders, and stay alive long enough to do both.",

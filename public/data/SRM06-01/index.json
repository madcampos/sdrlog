	"description": "Darkness gathers in certain corners of the Sixth World, where no light can enter. The Containment Zone of Chicago has long been one of these dark spots, but government and corporate forces have combined their heft to bring some light to that benighted area, if only because they believe there is profit to be extracted. They have considerable powers at their disposalâ€”but there is also considerable darkness pooled in the ruined sprawl. It will be a battle, and as usual, shadowrunners will be used as the front-line soldiers.\nIn this Mission, runners will be called to investigate the case of some missing people and stolen augmentations. Answers are not easy to come by in the CZ, but trouble is, and runners will encounter plenty. If they want to dig deep into the heart of what's happening in the CZ, they better stay on their toes and ready for anything.",

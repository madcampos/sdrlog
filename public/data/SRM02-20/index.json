	"description": "Harold Benson hires the runners to prevent one of his researchers, Marvin Fitz, from being extracted. Benson knows the extraction is voluntary, but does not disclose this information. He explains that Marvin has a non-working prototype with him that must be kept out of the competition's hands at all costs.\nBenson suggests that the PCs start at Fitz's apartment, where they may learn that his extraction was voluntary. From there, they catch up to Marvin in the plaza of the Happy Canyon shopping mall in Chinatown.\nAfter a quick negotiation, the real extraction team, a professional squad working for the Vory, ambushes them. The Vory team knows Fitz has implanted his research project into his own head, and that it works, but they don't know what it does. The opposing team also knows that the extraction is a scam: Fitz is actually being captured to be sold to the highest bidder.\nFrom there, it's a matter of safely securing Fitz and deciding what to do with him.",

	"description": "When developing Shadowrun, we come across all sorts of ideas. Good ideas. Crazy ideas. Ideas guaranteed to make us require yet more expensive psychotherapy bills. Yet we don't believe there are bad ideas—only ideas that need the right outlet. Street Legends: Home Edition is our way of providing a place for those ideas that, in normal circumstances, leave us shaking our heads in confusion and/or despair.\nMeet an ork in a sequined white jumpsuit, a ninja elf stripper, a set of triplets with an unusual bond, and the most enthusiastic, cheerful shadowrunner you'll ever meet. They may not be you're typical runners, but they're all legends—in the sense of, if you met them, you'd still have trouble believing they existed.",

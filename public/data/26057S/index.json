	"description": "Devils in the White City\n\nCasablanca-Rabat is a sprawl with millions of secrets and a willingness—an eagerness, even—to sell them. That means there is plenty of work for shadowrunners, but also a need for care, since revealing the wrong secret at the wrong time can lead to disaster. So get to know the city, get to know the culture, and learn how to play the game. Then take your running to the next level in one of the most vital sprawls of the Sixth World.\n\nShadows in Focus: Casablanca-Rabat follows Shadows in Focus: Morocco to fill in details of Africa's northwestern shore, and you can either use both books to build in-game knowledge or focus on this one to help you launch shadowruns in a sprawl with a deep history of intrigue.",

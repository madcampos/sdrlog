Talk a walk down any street and read the writing on the wall:\n\"Welcome to the Sprawl, chummer. Too bad you could make it.\"\nSprawl Sites is a sourcebook for Shadowrun, First Edition, and includes hundreds of encounters of every type, from blood-crazed gangs and mystic magicians to mild-mannered Orks and back-stabbing Corporate Cops. Plus, you'll find Location Archetypes covering typical Sprawl locations from all sides of town, eight new Player Archetypes, and dozens of Non-Player Contacts. Round that out with additional essays and rules concerning sprawl law and credsticks, and you've got a whole new adventure on your hands. Your Shadowrun campaign will never be the same.",

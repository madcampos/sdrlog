	"description": "PICKING UP THE PIECES! Pre-order from our first-ever series of jigsaw puzzles for Shadowrun, printed right here in the USA! Five different images, done in high-quality foil and cut to a 500-standard piece puzzle. Each assembled puzzle is 18″ x 24″ and suitable for framing when complete. These puzzles are all limited to foiled print runs of 1000. Once they are gone, that's it. These are a \"while supplies last\" offer. If they appear again, they will be in standard paper, not foiled.",

	"description": "Being a spellcaster is all about taking the inconveniences and problems of reality and making them work for you. But reality is a complicated thing, and if you really want to shape it right, you need plenty of spells at your disposal. And not just any spellsâ€”the right ones, the ones that get the job done. Street Grimoire Spell Cards have summaries of 54 spells from Street Grimoire, with stats, a brief statement of what the spell does, and references to help you find more information. Use them to shift reality from the way it is to the way it should be.",

	"description": "All Kinds of Power\n\nArcane sites crackling with magical energy. High-stakes corporate maneuvering, complete with draconic influence. Smugglers and shamans, charismatic chiefs and feckless rogues. All this and more waits in the Sioux Nation for runners looking to branch out and run headfirst into new challenges in the unending quest to earn a few nuyen while staying alive and free from corporate detention facilities.\nShadows in Focus: Sioux Nation is the first in a new series of Shadowrun e-books providing a detailed look at geographical spots that have not been covered recently—or at all—in previous books. Starting with an overview of the Sioux Nation—including corporate powers, magical sites, major cities, adventure hooks, and more—the series will continue with spotlights on two major cities, Cheyenne and Butte, adventures set in the Sioux Nation, and an Enhanced Fiction story providing more flavor of what it's like to run in the Sioux Nation. While the full collection of e-books will provide a detailed look at a nation reconciling old traditions with life on the bleeding edge of magic and technology, the Sioux Nation book has all you need to bring your Shadowrun game into this locale and see if runners can handle the full range of challenges it will throw at them.",

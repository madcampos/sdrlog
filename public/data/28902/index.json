A must-own for any Shadowrun or even cyberpunk fan who wants to display some of the best art in RPG history. \n\n- Images span the entire history and include some high-profile artists such as Larry Elmore and Echo Chernik.\n- Some images were selected through a fan-voting process, so the book reflects fan preferences and has their investment.\n- With each page being a detachable poster, fans get a lot of variety and options for how they want to show their favorite side of Shadowrun!",

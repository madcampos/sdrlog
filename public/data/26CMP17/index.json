It turns out he is a Yakuza boss' son. Now, you just have to prevent an all-out war in the shadows. When the son of an international crime lord's son goes missing a gang war is ready to erupt out of the shadows; and that would be bad for biz. Perhaps some neutral, outsiders can run the shadows quick enough to keep the peace - such as it is.\n\nCMP 2017-06 - A Friend in Need\nA friend of a friend needs his hoop pulled from the fire. Then, his friends want to send a message to those who run in the shadows by arranging revenge against the one who burned him. The revenge needs to be public and precise.

Then, there is the small matter of dealing with the one who betrayed him.",

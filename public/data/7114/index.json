And the lessons men and women learn on those fields of fire can save their reputations-and their lives-in any combat situation.\nFields of Fire is the mercenary sourcebook for Shadowrun. Information on how to act like a professional merc, and pages of new weapons, support gear, and optional combat-rules clarifications and expansions make this book something no merc, or runner, should live without.",

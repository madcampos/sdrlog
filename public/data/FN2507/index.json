Thought long dead, he was recently discovered commanding the Recon and Advance Tactical Strikeforce during the Shadow War against the Disian invasion. But when two enterprising hackers blow his cover, everyone wants him to join their side against the otherworldly incursion.\n\nThe only issue is, Roger isn’t all that keen to sign up again…with anyone.

It’s going to be a wild ride through the city streets…and Roger will need all of his skills and luck to escape in one piece…",

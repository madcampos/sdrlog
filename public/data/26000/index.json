	"description": "The year is 2072. Magic has returned and creatures of myth and legend walk among us as megacorps bleed the world dry. You're a shadowrunner—a deniable asset, a corporate pawn—using bleeding-edge science and magic to make your meat body and mind better-than-flesh. Stay on the edge, and you may survive another run on the mean sprawl streets.",

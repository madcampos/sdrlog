You're walking with a certain confidence, maybe even a little strut. You're ready for the next thing the streets are going to throw at you.\nAt least, you think you are. Now you're going to find out.\nHigh Caliber Ops is a massive expansion for the award-winning Shadowrun: Crossfire deck-building game. How massive? How does two new character roles, more than a dozen new Black Market cards, fifty new obstacles, and a large bundle of new Karma upgrades sound? On top of that, we've got five brand-new missions, and a set of basic cards with new art. Taken together, you have the tools for high-powered, high-risk, high-reward shadowruns. Add High Caliber Ops to your Crossfire game to see just how much danger you can take on!",

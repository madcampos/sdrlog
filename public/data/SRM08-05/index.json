	"description": "The Other Shoe\nSome people working on bringing the core of Chicago back to life are brimming with optimism about its future. Others have spent the whole time waiting for the other shoe to drop. Well, it's about to stomp down—hard. If the runners have ever wondered just how bad things might be in the tunnels under the Containment Zone, they're about to find out, since that's where Mr. Johnson wants them to go. What's waiting for them will shake the foundations of the sprawl—as long as they survive long enough to tell someone what they discover.",

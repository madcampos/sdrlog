	"description": "There are certain things shadowrunners know. They know Mr. Johnson will not tell you everything. They know sometimes the things you don't know can kill you. And they know that one of the keys to survival is staying one step ahead of the opposition—or, in times when you are working for a devious Mr. Johnson, not falling too many steps behind.\nThe corporate enclave of Manhattan is the scene for some high-stakes manipulation that will test just how skilled shadowrunners are. Killing Pawn is a Prime Mission, a higher-level challenge designed for characters that have already triumphed in a large number of regular Missions and are ready for something tougher. Runners will have to think fast and shoot even faster if they want to come out ahead in this game—or at least not get captured in the first few moves.",

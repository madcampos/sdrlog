	"description": "During the excavation for the foundation of a new building, a forgotten drainage pipe was found. Wuxing, who owns the building site, suspects it leads under the nearby sector border into the neighboring sector. They sent in an exploration team. This team reported some disturbing findings via commlink. Then all communication broke down.\nEnter the runners. Wuxing hires them to explore the drainage system, find the first exploration team and bring them back alive, if possible.\nIt all comes down to a bit of a dungeon crawl with the runners never knowing what horrors lurk around the corner. Along the way, they may find one very disturbed member of the first exploration team.\nThe finale has the runners entering the final chamber where Enrico Trebol, an Aztec Blood Mage, is just finishing a nasty sacrifice ritual on the survivors of the missing team. Trebol is crazed and confused. He's spent years living alone in the tunnels, forgotten by the corp when Ghostwalker threw Aztechnology out of Denver. He has spent years transforming the tunnels to accommodate his crazy delusions.",

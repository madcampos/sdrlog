	"description": "# VEXING MEGACORPS FOR FUN AND PROFIT…\n\nLandon and Liana Hoffman are on summer vacation, and look forward to producing their Matrix repair show, the Right2RepairRigger, and hanging out at the local makerspace. But when they get a chance at a lucrative salvage run, they can't say no—especially when they owe the fixer who's hiring them.\n\nBeyond settling their account, the job promises untold riches in salvageable, possibly beyond state-of-the-art gear at a secret, abandoned military facility. Aware of the dangers involved, the run is still too good to pass up. However, the place may not be as abandoned as it seems—and the clock is ticking.\n\nAlso, there are powerful enemies who don't like what the Right2RepairRigger is doing, and are willing to destroy whoever they can to put a stop to it—including arresting anyone possibly connected with the twins' program. Can Landon and Liana finish the run and save their family at the same time?",

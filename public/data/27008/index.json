	"description": "The Wild Calls\n\nGangers. Corp security. Mr. Johnson. Organized crime. Other shadowrunners. Running in the Sixth World does not exactly lack for obstacles, but only foolish runners worry solely about metahuman opponents. There are plenty of other ways the world can kill you, from throat-ripping martachoras to blood-sucking chupacabras, from the aggressive gamma spider to the swarming harpy. While most runners would be happy to simply avoid these threats, it's not always possible. Critters may be used as security, they may swarm in abandoned areas runners must investigate, or they may carry valuable reagents runners need. Some of them may even hold the keys to unlocking the sort of powers runners covet.",

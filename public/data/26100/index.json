	"description": "NEVER GO IN UNARMED!\n\nWhen you go into a tight spot, you go in prepared. One gun might be good, but two is better. And two guns and a grenade launcher is better still. Throw in a spellslinger to watch your back, and you're on to something. Runner's Toolkit is the well-stocked arsenal all runners should have, the ultimate accessory to the Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary core rulebook. Inside you'll find:\n\n\t- A deluxe, four-panel gamemaster's screen that puts critical information directly in front of you;\n\t- On the Run , one of Shadowrun's most popular introductory adventures;\n\t- Contacts, Adventures and Sprawl Sites, a booklet that gives you the who, what, and where to launch runners on new missions;\n\t- 4 laminated maps of Sprawl Site locations;\n\t- The Pre-generated Auxiliary Character and Kit System, a modular system that makes character and NPC generation simple while keeping characters highly customizable;\n\t- Anatomy of a Shadowrun , a two-column book; one column tells the story of a high-stakes run, while the other details the players and those involved in the run-up encounter, giving gamers a look at how a Shadowrun game flows;\n\t- Six quick-reference sheets, with the gamemaster's screen, greatly reduces the time spent flipping through books to find a particular rule;\n\t- A Shadowrun logo sticker;\n\t- A poster of the Sixth World Seattle skyline, and\n\t- A book compiling tables from Arsenal, Street Magic, Augmentation and Unwired - it's the ultimate shopping list for runners!\n\nRunner's Toolkit is an adrenaline shot to the heart of your Shadowrun game, jolting your runners and keeping them moving up and down.

	"description": "Sixth World scholars have long hypothesized the cyclical nature of magic. For years corporations, collectors and other factions have spent fortunes hunting down surviving relics of this mythical age. The shadows whisper of lost lore and a secret history to the world. A privileged few have come into possession of ancient items of great power and mysterious purpose, artifacts from before recorded history. Now it's your turn...\nOn the surface, the job seems simple: escort and assist Ms. Johnson as she follows the trail of a man across the globe. The target? An agent of the Atlantean Foundation tracking a priceless stolen artifact. And the trail? It leads to Lagos, the most dangerous sprawl on earth, where simply surviving the day can be a run in its own right. Add in the biggest black market auction of the century, a powerful African king, and a plethora of the biggest players in the artifacts trade, from the Atlantean Foundation to Aztechnology... well, welcome to the underside of the artifact business. If you survive, there's more work a-coming… and maybe even some answers to your questions.",

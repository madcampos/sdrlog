They call it Mercy Street and it’s a practically free clinic run by a drunk old troll named Shimura, who’s seen a lot in his years.\n\nWhen a decker named Lockdown Paradox shows up bleeding on his doorstep, it’s just an average Tuesday, but when corporate stooges looking for her show up and try to shake Shimura down for information, he wonders just what this kid hacker’s gotten herself into. But he’s not the only one wondering…Paradox thinks there’s more to the ol’ whiskey doc than meets the eye, wondering if he might be a legendary shadowrunner that might be able to help her.\n\nWhen she turns up missing, Shimura is forced to go far deeper into the sleaze and sprawl than he ever wanted to...and return to a part of his past he’d sworn to leave behind if he wants to get both of them out alive…",

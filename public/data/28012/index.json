	"description": "## POWER SHIFT\n\nThe only constant when it comes to magic is change. Since the Awakening, those who can access the powers of magic have attempted to tame it and bend it to their will. And for a time, magicians thought they’d mastered the arcana. But like a true force of nature, magic suddenly changed the rules.\n\nThe upheaval of the manasphere following the the Disian Shadow War has brought significant changes to magic, changes that aren’t quite yet understood but already being seen and felt. Magic is both familiar and different.\n\nCurrent methodologies aren’t always working, forcing some magicians to return to older ways in order to move into the future. Can the Awakened adapt to these changes, or will they simply fade into history?",

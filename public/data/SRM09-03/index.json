Runners are going to be asked to influence the election, and they'll have to deal with the candidates, their backers, and anyone else who wants things to go their way. They'll have plenty of obstacles to overcome and decisions to make—are they just going to work for pay, or will they try to get the right person into office? Assuming they can decide who that is.",

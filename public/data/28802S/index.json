	"description": "## Night Music\n\nNew Orleans moves from night to night—the day is just a brief break between the times when the real action happens. Once the sun goes down, jazz spills into the streets, spirits walk free, and people indulge in all manner of semi-legal and illegal activities. \n\nIt’s a prime sprawl for crime, and there’s money to be made in the shadows. But first, shadowrunners need to know the basics of the city. That’s what this book is for. You’ll find everything from geography to demographics to major players inside, leaving you fully ready to take on the Big Easy.",

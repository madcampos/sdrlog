	"description": "## Back Together\n\nAfter decades divided but now united, the Republic of Korea now stands on its own in the Sixth World. Despite constantly being overshadowed by the Imperial Japanese State and the Japanacorps, the ROK is far from the subservient nation most people think it is. Much more than just K-pop and kimchi, the ROK is a country where the bright neon and shadows mix, creating a place where opportunities await for those brave or bold enough to seize them. But don't wait too long to make a move, because things happen fast in the Republic of Korea. Because if you aren't keeping up, you're being left behind. ",

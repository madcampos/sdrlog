	"description": "Auslander. If you haven't heard the name, you're lucky. If you have heard it, then you know enough to be worried. But not scared, because fear's not part of the job. Which is good, because the job Mr. Johnson's got in store for you is a big oneâ€”going to Auslander's home metaplane and talking him out, once and for all.\nIt's not safe. Of course it's not. Even the act of getting to the metaplane will cost blood, and nothing gets easier from there. Every type of assault will be thrown at the runners, and they will need every milligram of their considerable skills if they want to succeed and, somehow, survive.",

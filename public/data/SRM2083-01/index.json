	"description": "War and Chess have always been linked. Both rely on the moving of pieces and assets to achieve victory. Ares Macrotechnology has long had a connection to both war and Chess. For decades they’ve supplied weapons and engaged in numerous shadow wars while their leadership embraced the stratagems of Chess. But now, they’re putting those ideas to the test and taking part in the final battle of the biggest shadow war in history. In an operation no one has undertaken before, Ares military augmented by scores of volunteer forces have taken the fight to the Disians’ home metaplane. This is a battle where one wrong move could determine ultimate victory, or complete destruction.",

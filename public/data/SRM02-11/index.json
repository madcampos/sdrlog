	"description": "The runners are hired by Tabby to raid a Yakuza parlor. The 3-story building is situated in the UCAS sector. It's an old but well maintained beige brick building in a quiet part of town. The Yakuza discreetly run an illegal brothel and casino from there.\nThe first floor serves as a posh welcoming lobby and lounge. Prostitutes and geishas not serving anyone lounge around and are on display for incoming clients. A kitchen also prepares small meals and snacks for customers, whether gamblers or those enjoying the services of the prostitutes. The back rooms serve as security HQ for the operation. Yakuza soldiers monitor camera feeds and other security measures, as well as standing-by in case of trouble.\nThe 2 stories above ground are simply hotel-like rooms where customers enjoy the services of the prostitutes. There are about a half a dozen rooms per floor, so a dozen in total. Yakuza security is discreet here. Nothing much of interest for the runners.\nThe building also has a basement, where the casino is. The usual attractions can be found, ranging from cards to roulette to mah jong. The setting continues to be posh, but security here is more obvious and well armed, reminding customers that cheating is a very bad idea, as well as protecting valuables. There are also a number of customers, employees and waitresses.\nThe runners' target is a small room connected to this casino. It is protected by additional security measures, and it holds important offline data. The runner team will have to access this server to obtain the paydata they are after. The mainframe will be hackable, especially for a team with a competent hacker or technomancer. An alternate method would be to force a captured Yakuza technician to give them access codes.",

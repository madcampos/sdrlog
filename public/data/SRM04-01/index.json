	"description": "If the Ork Underground is going to become an official district in Seattle, it's going to need some cleaning up. Even if it's not, some of the criminals down there have a pesky habit of bringing their activities to the surface, and plenty of people want them eliminated. Seattle law enforcement has had enough, and ADA Dana Oaks is determined to bring down some of the higher-profile criminals of the Undergroundâ€”starting with a mob enforcer who goes by the name of Junior.\nCriminals in the Underground don't go down easy, though, and shadowrunners are going to have to use all their skills to track Junior down. When they find him, they might discover that their task isn't quite as straightforward as they may have thought.",

	"description": "# NO ONE ASKED FOR IT\n\nBut you get it anyway! The BattleTech and Shadowrun streams have crossed again, and we return to the Eighth World setting for Battlerun II: The Quest for the Thing! Join Jonas Hadry and whoever is lucky enough to travel alongside him as they look for a legendary object that will almost certainly have some sort of effect on the universe in which they live! This is the adventure that has everythingâ€”random plotlines, predictive text prompts, inaccurate trivia, and footnotes, footnotes, footnotes! It's a role-playing adventure that dares to ask: Can you figure out how to actually play it all the way through? Good luck!\n\nBattlerun II is kind of for use with Shadowrun, Sixth World, and maybe a little bit with MechWarrior: Destiny, but you meet its intended spirit best if you just kind of make crap up as you go.",

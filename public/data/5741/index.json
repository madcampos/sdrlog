She's his former partner--and lover. And now she's in the deepest drekpot of her life. Heading an op on a datasnatch turned bad, she's been stranded by the megacorp she works for--and targeted for flatlining by two more. Unless Argent gets to her first...\nRecruiting a top-notch team for the exfiltration shadowrun, Argent is risking it all--his money, his reputation, and his life--for the woman who once walked away from him. It's suicide mission through high-caliber hell. But that's never stopped the steel-armed, street samurai before...",

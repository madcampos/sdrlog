	"description": "Are you ready to risk everything? The Sixth World. One of the most enduring RPG settings ever created, with shadows growing deeper and darker in its latest edition. Dominated by enormous, world-striding megacorporations strangling metahumanity in their clutches, by 2080 most of the planet has surrendered to these corporate overlords. But from the darkest shadows, defiance flickers in people known as shadowrunners. They risk everything—wrestling magical energies, channeling them into power; putting their minds against the electronic void of the Matrix; trading flesh and blood for chrome and steel. Stand up, join them, and dare to risk it all!\nShadowrun: Sixth World builds on Shadowrun's amazingly successful legacy, becoming easier to learn and play while still providing role-playing depth. Welcome to the marquee event of the game's 30th Anniversary year! It all starts with the Shadowrun: Sixth World Beginner Box, releasing in June.",

There is a wider range of sapience than people in the previous century dreamed of, and regardless of the forms they come in, when two minds meet, they can forge a connection. Shadowrunners are going to have to deal with wrinkles in the processes of life and love they might not have considered, and they’ll have to see if they can preserve both of those things—which are all too fragile.\n\n_SRM 10-05 The Out of Body Experience is a Tokyo mission that is dual-statted for use with Shadowrun, Sixth World and Shadowrun, Fifth Edition._",

	"description": "Every day in the Sixth World people die in a thousand different ways. Every day blood is spilled. Every place that rain falls, it washes away some of the red that stains the streets.\nEliminating every killer in the Sixth World is as impossible as drying up every raindrop in a storm, but Thomas McAllister doesn't want to get rid of all of them. Just one. He's been on this killer's trail for a while, and he knows he's getting closer. The only question is if he'll be able to handle getting as close as he's about to be, or if his blood will join the stream that regularly flows into the gutters of the sprawls.",

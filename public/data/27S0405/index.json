You're going to choose your weapon carefully, and you know that the more options you have, the better your final choice will be.\nThese 33 weapon cards feature guns first seen in the recently released Gun H(e)aven 3. Available in both PDF and POD form, these cards have everything you need to start shooting right away!",

	"description": "# Grand Finale\n\nYou always get the most fireworks at the end of the show, and that’s the case for the Neo-Tokyo arc of Shadowrun Missions. The conflict between Yakuza factions comes to a head, and the PCs can play a key role in ending it—or escalating it. They’re given a list of names to take out. Do they do it? Who do they go after first? How far are they willing to go? These and other questions will change the face of Neo-Tokyo—and could alter the shadowrunners’ lives forever.",

	"description": "The Kirillov Vory have made inroads into the Warrens, rolling street gangs where possible and destroying others. With their growing influence, the Golden Triangle has lost a number of brothels and enforcers. Mikael Petrov has formulated a plan to drive a wedge between the Triad syndicates by specifically targeting the Golden Triangle and not harming the White Lotus.\nIn addition to the wedge Petrov wants to drive between the Triads, he is cleaning up a few loose ends of his own. He is trying to deal with the now defunct Fomin Vory, Tamanous (ghoul organleggers), and the Fronts - a local gang who has become a recurring thorn in his side (see SRM02-10 Twist and Insult).",

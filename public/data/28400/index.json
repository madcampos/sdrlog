	"description": "NIGHT FALLS...IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE\n\nThe first night of a citywide blackout usually has rioting and lawlessness. The second night continues the chaos. The third night? Well, whoever heard about a citywide blackout going three nights?\n\nIt's about to happen, and shadowrunners caught in the middle will have to deal with more than darkness. There will be howling critters roaming free. Strange spirits and twisted metaplanar beings appearing and pursuing unknown goals. And mysterious vans that somehow still have power slowly roaming the streets, sending out some sort of signal.\n\nThe streets will be getting more dangerous, and shadowrunners will be in the middle of it, first trying to survive, then trying to earn some cash, and finally trying to uncover the secrets the blackout was supposed to hide.",

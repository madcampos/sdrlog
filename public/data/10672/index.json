	"description": "\"I've got a job for you.\"\n\n\"Call me Mr. Johnson. I'm like a fixer for the corps. I know everybody who's anybody from suit-and-tie boardroom predators to bottom-feeder street-level scavengers. I know the best sprawl sites for scoring new talent, exchanging goods without interruption or hiding out from the hit men on your tail. I like to ensure that the people I hire can execute a well-planned black ops job and keep their faces from being splashed all over the screamsheets. My files on you say that you're right for what I have in mind. Interested?\"",

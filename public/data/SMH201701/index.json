	"description": "Sid Gambetti contact the runners to meet him at the Hawthorne Grill to discuss a job. Once the team arrives at the restaurant, Sid lays out the details of the run and negotiates. The team is to meet with two clients near an MCT Research Facility for an extraction. Once they are secured, the team and clients are to go to the nearby docks to escape via boat. At the end of negotiations, the restaurant gets robbed with the team still inside.\nThe team loads into a VTOL commuter aircraft and begins the trip to a remote coastal town in Chile. The VTOL stops to allow the runners to parachute to the rendezvous coordinates, drawing the Chilean force's attention. After the runners parachute out of the plane, it is hit with a missile and spirals out of control. Pieces of the VTOL break apart and smash into containment biodomes outside of the MCT Research Facilityâ€”freeing dangerous research specimens into the night.",

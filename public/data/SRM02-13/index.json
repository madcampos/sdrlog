	"description": "After taking a call to meet at the Splatter Bar, the runners are contracted to collect black mail material on Lin Yao. The Vory want the runners to eliminate another team of runners and take a job from Lin Yao. It is important that they record the meeting, and after completing the secondary run bring one of the participants (Chun Xiang) from that run back to the Vory.\nLin Yao's job involves kidnapping a woman who is the current lover of a member of the Triad and the former lover of Lin Yao. It's believed that the recording plus the risk of harm to Chun will give them sufficient leverage on Lin to get what the Vory want. The fact that Chun is also a skilled smuggler is just an additional bonus in Fomin's mind.\nOnce the team decides who they're actually willing to work for and how they'll follow through on the run, they need to deal with at least one of several Johnsons all looking for a double cross.",

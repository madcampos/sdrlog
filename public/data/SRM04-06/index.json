	"description": "The Sixth World is full of dark crevasses and corners where people can hide. Where they can go when the rest of the world has told them they don't belong. Where they can be forgotten. People who disappear into these places become secrets, whispered threats of a mysterious something that lurks just out of sight.\nSome people—the normal ones, the sane ones—avoid these dark corners and any danger they might be hiding, but shadowrunners don't have that choice. The dark corners are where they live. So when Mr. Johnson needs some information that's hidden in one of these places, you know that he's not going after it himself. He'll send some runners instead and let them deal with whatever might be waiting for them.",

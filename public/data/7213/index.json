For at the heart of war-torn Aztlan lies Aztechnology, a potential mother lode of paydata and newtech, and an almost certain source of death. Listen carefully to the rumors and judge for yourself which are true or false—Aztlan guards its secrets well, and Aztechnology will kill to keep it that way.",

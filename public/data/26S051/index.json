	"description": "The Price of Power\nValue is not a secret. When something is worth a lot of money, or conveys a lot of power, or both, people of the Sixth World know. They make it their business to know. That means that when you're tracking down something with a lot of value, be cautious. You won't be the only one after it.\nIn Lethal Forces, Mr. Johnson comes along spinning tales about secret research in a highly secure facility, which is definitely the sort of thing that has a lot of value. Mr. Johnson may not tell the runners who else might come calling, but what self-respecting team of runners relies on Mr. Johnson to give them the information they need? They'll have to stay alert, keep their wits about them, and be ready for any and all oppositionâ€”including ones with scales.",

	"description": "Tensions don't simmer for long in the Sixth World. They build, and then they explode. In Chicago's Containment Zone, that time has come. From the hunt for the missing Samantha Villiers (in her various guises) to rising gang tensions to mysterious strangers building power bases for secretive purposes, there are plenty of unstable reagents mixing in the CZ, and they're about to blow. Shadowrunners are going to be right in the middle of it all—aren't they always?—and they'll have to see how many lives they can save. Including their own.",

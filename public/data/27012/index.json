	"description": "Street fighting is only chaotic for amateurs. When you're a pro, when you know what you're doing, you're precise. You know what your opponents might do, and you know ten different ways to respond. The options give you strength. They give you power. They make you dangerous enough that the smart ones on the street will know at a glance that they shouldn't test you. The dumb ones will suffer.\nStreet Lethal contains the data, tools, and options players need to maximize their characters' combat skills. With briefings on the security techniques of major corporations, information on major mercenary groups and their operations, and a whole truckload of firearms options, this book has all runners need to make sure they're the ones left standing at the end of a fight.",

	"description": "If constant friction makes things hot, then the Ork Underground is ready to blaze. Proposition 23, known to some as \"Project Freedom,\" is coming closer to a vote, and it could make the Ork Underground a full district of the city of Seattle. People on both sides are willing to do just about anything to make the vote go their way, and they're demonstrating that willingness with blades, bullets, explosives, and more. This has become more than a fight for votesâ€”it's a struggle for survival.",

	"description": "## Some Jobs are Cursed Before They Begin\n\nIn this high-stakes Shadowrun Missions adventure, your team is hired by Am-mut, a Cairo-based fixer with ties to Egypt’s outlawed magical circles. The task seems simple: get to the Al Wadi Al Gadid Desert, retrieve a mysterious crate from Kahf Al-Zilal, the Cave of Shadows, and deliver it to Cairo. But nothing about this run is simple.\n\nA cinematic journey across Egypt: desert drop, checkpoint evasion, Nile River chase, and a final showdown in a crumbling dye factory. A magically charged artifact that warps reality and attracts deadly attention; from paranormal scorpions to awakened crocodiles. Whether your runners are chasing nuyen or chasing purpose, Cave of Shadows delivers a thrilling descent into the unknown. Just don’t open the crate.",

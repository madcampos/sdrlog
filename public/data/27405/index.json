	"description": "IT'S GOING DOWN\n\nIn any given sprawl, there are a few million people who hate a few million other people in an endless cycle of grudges and hostility. What keeps the peace is that most of the people lack the power to do anything about their anger, so a status quo of simmering tension is maintained. Problem is, if some of the angry parties got their hands on enough power of any kind, those simmering tensions would explode. DeeCee, the UCAS capital, is full of all kinds of power, and enough factions are grabbing for it that the prospect of open fighting or worse is growing.\nThis is especially worrisome since some of the factions have nothing on their mind other than utter destruction. The law firm of Stark, Theissen, and Van Der Mar is making too much money from the status quo to want it to change, and they're about to discover that shadowrunners might be the only thing that can stop the advancing secret plots from plunging the sprawl into complete disaster.\nToxic Alleys is a complete adventure for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition. While it draws on existing plot lines, it stands on its own and can be enjoyed by any team of runners looking for a challenge.",

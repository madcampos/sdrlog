	"description": "Killing the competition is no longer a figure of speech...\n\nThe boardrooms become war rooms as the movers and shakers shift their fights from the stock exchange to the streets. Using everything from military-scale assaults on ultra-secure company compounds to stealth missions and sabotage, the fat cats have gone to war. Dunkelzahn's will made the head of security for Fuchi Industrial Electronics a voting member of Renraku's board of directors - and all hell broke loose. Now Fuchi is in a civil war that may destroy the corporation. Renraku is under siege on every front and must turn to an old enemy to survive, as Ares goes on the offensive to purge itself of traitors. Even minor-leaguer Yamatetsu must fight its way out of Japan when a metahuman takes over the helm.\nThe most desired asset in this upheaval isn't a stack of stocks or a portfolio of investments, but a professional shadowrun team willing to keep its mouth shut and do the job.",

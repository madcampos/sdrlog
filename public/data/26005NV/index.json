Her suspicions are confirmed when what should be a simple convoy heist nearly goes lethally awry. And when Maria’s investigations find an innocent man marked for death, she suddenly has to decide between the corp that has given her everything and the fate of one man…and if she makes the wrong choice, she could be targeted for termination by her own employers…",

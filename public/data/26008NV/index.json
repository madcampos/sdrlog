There's nothing to do but round up all their badass runner contacts, light up a spliff, and kick some ass. But this run will take them under the sea to a top-secret covert lab where Kofo cultists are hiding a weapon that could change the face of the entire Caribbean…and only T'ing and his hard-partying—and even harder-charging—crew stand in their way...",

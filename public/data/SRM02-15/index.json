	"description": "A DocWagon executive, Brent Fuller, hires the team to investigate a situation regarding patients that are disappearing. They are told that the investigation must be kept absolutely quiet for public relations purposes. He gives them the files on the three missing women.\nLegwork provides the runners with leads on a fake DocWagon ambulance, potential additional victims, and the grunts responsible for the kidnappings.\nEventually, the runners learn about the Farm - a site where metahumans are grown for organ harvesting. To their horror, they discover ghouls run the site. The run concludes as the team fights their way free with the survivors while the ghouls or their associates pursue.",

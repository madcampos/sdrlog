The team gets an interesting offer from someone they just had arrested. A little nuyen goes a long way toward forgiveness.\n\nCMP 2018-07 - Cerulean Shadows: No Prey, No Pay\nAn offer comes in from an independent Johnson looking to turn the screws on some of the shipping corporations operating in the Caribbean, and hopefully fund out why boatloads of people have gone missing.

Even the best kept secrets eventually come to light. A mysterious private island with a corporate facility, and hundreds of brainwashed prisoners stand between the runners and a real payday.",

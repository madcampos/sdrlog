	"description": "## Code Black in the Trauma Ward\n\nWhen a shadowrunner is injured on a run, it’s often up to their team to pull their hoop outta the fire. But when a runner’s whole team is gone and he’s the only survivor, they’re going to need some extra special help. Mr. Johnson hires you to break into a DocWagon hospital to get his guy out before Lone Star hauls him in for some intense conversations. It’d probably be easier if the target didn’t need to still be hooked up to all the fancy medical equipment.",

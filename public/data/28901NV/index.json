	"description": "FIVE RUNNERS. ONE JOB. AND A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE...\nIt should have been a simple walk in the corp. Stroll into a mid-level corporation disguised as a nameless mid-level manager in a suit, deliver an unknown data package to an isolated network, and stroll out again.\nBut nothing is ever simple in the shadows.\nNow five shadowrunners are on the run themselves. Framed by their employer, the mysterious Mr. Johnson, and marked for termination by every hired cop, corp security, and fellow shadowrunner in Seattle, the team must find out who set them up, why they did it, and figure out how to deliver paybackâ€”without getting killed in the process.\nThe Frame Job, Part 1 is the first in a brand-new, six-novella story set in the gritty, dark future, magic-and-machine world of Shadowrun. This ZIP file contains both the Kindle (.mobi) and the ebook versions of the story.",

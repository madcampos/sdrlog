All of these elements—and more—are coming together to give shadowrunners a long day and a longer night, as they move from trying to find what has been lost to struggling for their survival. And with what they're up against, survival would be a very notable accomplishment.\nWhether you have played previous Missions in Season Four or are just now diving into this plotline, SRM 04-10: Romero and Juliette provides a test for any group of shadowrunners while also increasing the intensity of the hunt for artifacts in Seattle. This one will give runners a story to tell over the next round of drinks, as long as they an stay alive long enough to buy one.",

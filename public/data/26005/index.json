	"description": "Across the Globe, Biz is Biz!\n\nThis first core setting introduces the players to two of the world's premier shadowrunner sprawls: Seattle and Hong Kong . Each city is described in detail for a shadowrunner's point-of-view, covering key topics such as the balance of power, corporate and underworld affairs, places to see, strange magics, and key features of interest. A wealth of plot hooks are also included. Four other runner-favored cities - Cape Town , Caracas , Hamburg , and Istanbul - are also covered in lesser detail, and gamemaster advice is provided for any specific urban locale into a shadow hotspot.",

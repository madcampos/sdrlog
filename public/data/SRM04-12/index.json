	"description": "The players are lined up. The goals are clear. The waiting is over. The ultimate rush is beginning, and it's going to pull a lot of dangerous elements closer and closer together until they explode.\nThe shadows of Seattle have been heaved this way and that in the Great Seattle Artifact Rush, and a fair number of artifacts have been collected (in exchange for a handful of deaths and a helping of destruction). The powers of the magical world have been alerted, and they ready to get their hands on as many artifacts as possible. This means shadowruns, which means plenty of runners are about to be caught up in one of the worst mana-based drek-storms to hit the city in a long while.\nWhat starts as an investigation into a museum heist rapidly grows into a conflagration that could consume a good part of the sprawl. Clever players will need to see if they can survive, and how much nuyen they can wrangle out of the fight. Hopefully they'll get enough for a nice vacation or significant medical treatment, because chances are that they're going to need both.",

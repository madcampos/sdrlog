Green-and-gorgeous Northern California, with a thousand mutually hostile small towns and crack Tir troops stepping right up to the tripwire? Or try your luck along the Big Sur coastline-you can either die from environmental poisons or get carved into tiny pieces by the pirates and smugglers who own the palce. How about Los Angeles, where rich simsense stars and even richer producers live just the other side of a plascrete wall from starving ork kids and strug-out chip heads?\nStill think the Golden State is a great place for a shadowrun?",

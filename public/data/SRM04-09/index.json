	"description": "The debate over the future of the Ork Underground is heating up. Proposition 23, which will decide whether or not the Underground becomes an official district of the city of Seattle, is coming up for a vote, and people on all sides are getting desperate. There are those, though, who understand that desperation can breed opportunity, and they are hatching plots that can help them take advantage of the chaos that is sure to rain down on the city. And there are others for who chaos is an end in and of itself.",

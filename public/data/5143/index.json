	"description": "The year is 2050\n\nThe blending of technology and human flesh began in the late 20th century. Interfacing the human mind with computers Then came the Awakening . A five-thousand-year zero in the flow of certain energy subsided, and magic returned to the world. Elves , Trolls , and Orcs assume their true form, throwing off their human guise. Dragons awoke from their long sleep and re-emerged into the world.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun . A world where technology and magic co-exist. A world filled with only two types of people. The quick on the dead. Your hosts on this run through the shadows are:\n\n\t - Ken St. Andre\n\t - Robert Charette\n\t - Elizabeth T. Danforth\n\t - Tom Dowd\n\t - Paul R. Hume\n\t - Lorelei Shannon\n\t - Nyx Smith\n\t - Michael A. Stackpole\nIn this brainded anthology, a mid-level executive makes his bid for the big time, and when superiors stand in his way, assassination and blackmail are the order of the day. Sorcerers , Yakuza , Street Samurai , The Ancients - on the Elven biker gangway - and the hopelessness of this dark future are the backdrop to this journey Into the Shadows.",

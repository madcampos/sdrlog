	"description": "This adventure focuses on gathering information about some non-sanctioned biz in Triad territory. The Golden Triangle has received word that a Johnson has been hiring runners for several months now to smuggle goods through Chinatown. They know that he works out of a local bar/nightclub called Happenstance. Despite the fact that Happenstance is controlled by the Casquilhos, Triad forces attempt to crash Mr. Johnson's party. The runners are among the witnesses. During the melee, runners see Mr. Johnson and his team. Having seen their faces, the Golden Triangle hires the runners to find out all they can about Mr. Johnson, the meet, and the biz.\nDespite being a simple package delivery, the runners find they are not alone. The Casquilhos, the Koshari, and the Vory are interested in the delivery. Along the way, the package stops at a warehouse, crosses the CAS/UCAS border, and ends in the Aurora Mall. The runners find that the package is destined for Tamanous organleggers. Can they get out with their skins intact?",

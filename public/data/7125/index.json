	"description": "Meet\nthe\nNew\nBoss...\n\nThe corporate war is over, but the corps need the shadows now more than ever as they scramble for position in the new power structure. Fuchi is dead, Novatech has risen from its ashes, and Wuxing and Cross have elbowed their way onto the Corporate Court. The corps have ceased their open conflict, but the guns are still drawn under the table...\nCorporate Download describes the history, power players and business interests of the ten top megacorps. Corporate Download focuses on information that runners need: the latest security trends, secret plans, dirty tricks, people to know and how to use them. Players will learn what working for each corp means for their characters, and gamemasters will find new rules for using and rating the megacorps in their campaigns.",

	"description": "An hour or so outside Chicago is a group of Amish—a group containing humans, metahumans, and centaurs—nicknamed the Neutral Amish because they are complete pacifists and stay to themselves. The Neutral Amish have many excellent craftsmen, and they build everything from commercial shipping pallets to fine furniture and wooden figurines. Simon Andrews was visiting this group to purchase miniatures for a game for one of Saeder-Krupp's subsidiaries when a herd-gang of centaurs known as the Bronies (yeah, you read that correctly) attacked the Neutral Amish, demanding food, money, and handmade garments. The Bronies killed an Amish family and burned their farm to the ground in the attack. This should be viewed as an isolated act of violence, not an indictment of all who bear the name \"brony.\"\nThe Amish held a community benefit auction to raise money to hire shadowrunners to deal with the problem. Simon Andrews offered up his services as a fixer for them, free of charge, because Simon is a softy who loves hand-crafted furniture.\nOnce hired, the shadowrunners will go to NuerTagDorf and investigate. While the runners are investigating, the Bronies will return and kidnap one of the Amish girls on the other side of town. The team will locate the Bronies' barn, only to find it empty save for a group of followers. From there they will return to the village to find an attack underway, as the Bronies are displeased with the lack of homemade garments, and think they need to teach the Neutral Amish that they are serious. There the final battle will take place.",

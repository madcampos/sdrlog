	"description": "Chicago's Containment Zone may be a hellish landscape where a formerly thriving sprawl turned into a nightmare, but it's got this going for itâ€”there's sure a wide variety of runs there. Finding missing people? Check. Locating data in abandoned facilities? Check. Big game hunting? Time to add that one to the list.\nSome mysterious attacks have left some dead, badly mauled bodies behind, and people who care about life in the CZ want to find out what's behind the attacks. In the best big game hunting tradition, they want the creature (or creatures, or whatever) brought back alive, the better to find out what's happening, and why.\nThis is Chicago, though, so nothing is going to be easy, and nothing is going to be straightforward. The runners are going to need their full breadth of skills if they want to make at least one corner of hell a little safer.",

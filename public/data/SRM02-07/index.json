	"description": "Doc Tico hires the runners to go in and bring back a quantity of the drug that he hopes will bring him more paying customers. He tells them where they can best get the drug in quantity, at the DocWagon PCC facility. Once the runners are in far enough that they can't back out, the hospital becomes awash with injuries brought in from a prison break attempt at the maximumsecurity detention center that's roughly a mile away. How much harder the run just got depends on what technique they chose to infiltrate.\nWhen they return to Doc Tico with the drugs they have a strong chance of learning that the doctor has been supplying parts to the Tamanous, though only what would otherwise be considered \"medical waste\" and nothing from anyone unwilling. They are then faced with an ethical dilemma: turn the doctor in and put the clinic out of business, or keep hush and let the downtrodden continue to get their low-cost yet decentquality medical care.",

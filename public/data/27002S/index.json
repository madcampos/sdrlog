	"description": "Big Bang Boom\n\nLook, do you want a really nice gun, or do you want something that's going to do the job? When you're firing a projectile at high speeds, do you really need frills like blued steel, personalized grips, or a safety? And when you're a real-sized being—like a troll or an ork, instead of one of the punier things—don't you want something that was designed from the ground up with you in mind?\n\nAll of this is why Krime exists—to give you what you want. From the beefy Krime Heater handgun to the overstuffed Krime Soldier to the rapid-firing Krime Monster, this catalog includes a full range of weapons, along with vehicles like the barely street legal Krime Wageslave and the abomination known as the Krime DeTruck Sports Truck. Oh, and some ammo and grenades thrown in, because that's the Krime way!",

	"description": "NOTHING BUT SHREDS\nNOTHING IS REAL. EVERYTHING IS REAL.\n\nWhat you think is real rips and shreds, and the unreality beneath spills out. Everything you dreamed of. Everything you fear. The past returns, distorted and dark. The future sparks in glimpses and flashes. You see it all at once. You can try to deny it. But it is real. Everything is real. Which is that same as nothing being real.\n\nReality is tearing apart. The holes are everywhere. Dive into them.",

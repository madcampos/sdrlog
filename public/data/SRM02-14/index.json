	"description": "This run focuses on an assassination near the town of Leadville. The characters are hired because Mr. Johnson (a Koshari plant) believes that his superiors had his corporate wife murdered and that one of his rivals gave the order. The runners will have to cross the border into PCC territory, travel through almost 200 km of PCC territory, kill the target, and return. Mr. Johnson will also stipulate that the run must be completed in three days, the death must appear accidental, and collateral damage must be kept to a minimum.\nOn the way there and back, they will have to deal with tightened security at the borders, getting around a gang turf war, altitude sickness (and other high-altitude problems), and overly curious PuebSec officers. The target's residence contains a corp bodyguard team, magic and mundane defenses, and a few surprises.",

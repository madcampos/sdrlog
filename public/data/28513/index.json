How to you get into where you’re not supposed to be? How to you stay unseen in spots with a thousand eyes watching? And how do you break the law regularly without being caught?\n\nShoot Straight provides runner-to-runner advice in a range of areas, from covert ops to con games to making sure you don’t blow your big score in one place. Anyone who wants to survive and thrive in the shadows could benefit from the advice—and plot ideas—this book holds.",

	"description": "\"Used to be, magic was pretty simple. Well, OK, not simple exactaly... but you knew where people stood with it. A magician was either a guy in the robes with the formulas or the guy summoning spirits in the wild with the bearskin and the rattle.\nNow the guy next door to me says he's a houngan practicing some mojo called voudoun. The kid down the block slings his juju based on an old flat-vid superhero show. Seems like the longer the Sixth World coes on, the more there is to learn about how magic works. And believe me, you'd better learn it--'cause in this biz, what you don't know can kill you.\"\n--Not Horatio, troll magician, Street Lectures Online",

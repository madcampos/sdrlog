	"description": "Layers of Power\n\nThe topmost layers of power have been scraped away, some wealth has been removed, but that doesn't mean the western borders of the UCAS have nothing of worth. Hidden weapons may yet be found. Secret powers may rise. And maneuvering for wealth? What would the Sixth World be without it?\n\nAge of Rust shines a spotlight on a part of the UCAS that is disintegrating but still has plenty of intrigue and shadow-work happening—maybe more than before, since the higher powers who might tamp it down have left town, leaving the layers below to rise up and fight.\n\nTales from the UCAS\n\nCombining immersive materials with spotlights on specific areas of the UCAS, the Tales from the UCAS series provides plot hooks, rules, and other material to add intrigue and excitement to your Shadowrun game while exploring how the changes that hit the UCAS will continue to shape the nation—and how shadowrunners will adapt and exploit what they encounter.",

	"description": "Shadowrunners have a lot of rules, and each and every one of them can be overruled by the proper amount of nuyen. So when shadowrunners talk about \"never trusting an elf,\" that's more of a bargaining position than anything else.\nLuckily for them, some elves have plenty of scratch they can use as a persuasive tool. And for the tasks they have in front of them, they're going to need it. There's money waiting for runners if they're willing to venture into elven territory and take on a host of odd jobs. Jobs like: Tracking down reagents from cranky critters. Messing around in the affairs of Tír royalty. Dealing with a number of different punks and thugs, none of whom like you. And intervening in a leadership challenge of the most powerful elven street gang there is.\nElven Blood is a compilation of five different Missions that have been written to premiere at summer 2012 conventions. They can, however, be played by anyone. Whether you're playing at a con, in a game store, or in the comfort of your own home, Elven Blood has an adventure for you. Taking you from the mean streets of Seattle to the wild lands of Tír Tairngire, Elven Blood offers exciting and inventive adventures for all Shadowrun fans.",

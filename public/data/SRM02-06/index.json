	"description": "The runners are hired to bring in a known smuggler who has gone to ground after ditching his goods half a klick from the border. Don Casquilho comes across as a nice old man with more grandchildren than hair left on his head and the Don says he just wants to talk.\nMeanwhile the Vory V Zakone are moving heavily into the smuggling business and ensuring that anyone who talks with the Mafia is pushing daisies by the end of the week. The runners will be introduced to Vory thugs, Avtoritey lieutenants, and have to decide which syndicate they are falling in line with.",

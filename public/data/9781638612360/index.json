	"description": "SOMETHING TO HIDE…\n\nBooker Coleman’s got a secret. He’s got a new job at a powerful law firm, earning more than he ever thought he could. He also has a past that, if key people knew about it, could bring his whole life crashing down.\n\nBut everyone around him has secrets, too. The mysterious client telling tales about disappearing corpses? The imperious senior partner? The too-confident consultant who seems to know everyone else’s business? They all have something to hide. Booker knows the danger of secrets that surprise you, so he’s out to figure them out before they can hurt him. That will take him deep into the corridors of power and to the biggest secret of all—a twisted scheme nothing prepared him for.\n\nJourneying from the Aurora Warrens to the halls of power in DeeCee and several points in between, Bad Faith is a Shadowrun novel where secrets will be uncovered—but not everyone will survive to learn all the answers.",

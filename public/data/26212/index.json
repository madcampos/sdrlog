	"description": "Digging in the dirt\n\nPolitics is only a dirty word when it's not working for you. For shadowrunners, politics aren't about debates and position papers—they're about taking some of the money people are throwing around.\nDuring election season, when power is up for grabs, people are willing to do just about anything to get a piece of the pie. If you can help them get what they want, they've got a job for you. It may be peeking in the windows of the rich and famous. Or finding dirt on the opposition (or making some up). Or, if things get really desperate, ensuring the other guy doesn't win because he's too busy taking a dirt nap.\nHow much money you take in and how dirty your fingers get is up to you and your desire to not see the stars above you when you sleep. You'll probably have to make some compromises along the way, but since when has life in the Sixth World—or politics—been any different?",

	"description": "Magic came back into the world nearly seventy years ago, bringing orks, elves, trolls, dwarfs, dragons, and all kinds of spells and magical critters. Dragons and megacorporations rule the skies and seas and everything in between with iron fists. Government power has faded as the corps wrap international economies around their bejeweled fingers. Most people survive by selling their souls to the megacorps, slaving away for their entire lives to stay safe and fed.\n\nHowever, not everyone is willing to bend. \n\nSome simply don't fit into the mold the corporations have prepared for them. They live in the cracks and margins of society—in the shadows. To survive, they do the things others won't, performing the grey ops the megacorps need in order to keep up with the competition.\n\nYou are one of those: a shadowrunner.",

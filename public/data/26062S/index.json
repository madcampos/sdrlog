	"description": "A New Shadowrun Short Story!\n\nMost Awakened folks in the Sixth World have Mentor Spirits to help them navigate the vast, often confusing world of magic. Many times, the mage chooses a spirit that compliments them, and can help them out in tough situations.\nAnd then there's Jimmy Kincaid.\nKincaid's never been one for taking the easy road, and to say his life is complicated is like saying water's wet. And when a simple trace job leads to a nest of Humanis thugs that have captured a metahuman hostage, well the voice of his Mentor Spirit isn't whispering peace and goodwill in the P.I.'s ear.\nBecause Kincaid's Mentor Spirit is Adversary … and Adversary just wants to see the world burn… Will Jimmy resist his mentor's siren call of death and destruction… or give in to those darker instincts and just level the entire place?",

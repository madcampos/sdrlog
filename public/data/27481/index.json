	"description": "Shadowrunning can take you all sorts of different places and give you the chance to have all sorts of different guns pointed at you. Whether you're exploring mysterious islands off the coast of Seattle, collecting bounties on the tightly guarded streets of Manhattan, or trying to survive the chaos and conflict in Bogotá, you're likely to find yourself in trouble and in the line of fire. Because that's where you're paid to be.\nFiring Line collects four Shadowrun Missions developed especially for the large summer gaming conventions, making them available for the first time to the gaming public. The adventures have all the statistics and game information needed for both Shadowrun, Fourth Edition and Shadowrun, Fifth Edition, meaning that a wide range of shadowrunners will have everything they need to dive into the adventures and get themselves in some high-paying trouble!",

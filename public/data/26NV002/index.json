Willing to go anywhere, rescue anyone, as long as that \"anyone\" has forked out enough advance cash to justify the effort.\nReporter Amelia Hart has embedded herself with a DocWagon team to see what their life is really like, and she's in for a wild ride. From an OD'ing celebrity to an aggressive team of hackers, from pesky gangs to an extremely rich and powerful client teetering at death's door, this night will give the team all they can handle. But will they survive long enough to remember that in the Sixth World, nothing is truly random?",

Selected from the gera, spells and weapons in Runner's Toolkit: Alphaware, these cards offer players more optins, with game stats for each item or spell. As in the Alphaware deck, gear items have color illustrations, and some common items are on multiple cards so that more than one player can have easy access to the game information.",

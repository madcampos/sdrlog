It's time to find out what Roger Soaring Owl learned.\nCorporate machinations don't get any meaner than this. Rivals of the megacorporation are certain it's hiding some dark secrets, and they're willing to spend significant nuyen to uncover this information. Runners are going to have to infiltrate an Ares subsidiary and gain the corporation's trust if they want to discover the secret—and if they do, they will have to find a way to survive with what they have learned.",

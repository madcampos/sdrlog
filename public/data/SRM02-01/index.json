	"description": "When you're working the Denver shadows, it's not just a matter of keeping the names and the faces straight. You need to remember which faction each person is working for. Parliament of Thieves introduces the runners to Denver, and exposes them to a number of the different factions of the city's underworld.\nThe adventure focuses on a short run from one sector (Pueblo) of Denver to another (UCAS). The characters are sneaking a hardcopy treaty letter from the Koshari to the sottocapo of the Chavez Mafia family. It already bears the signature of the Koshari council, and simply requires the sottocapo's signature. The characters don't have to worry about returning it. They were hired because both sides wanted the transport handled by a \"neutral third party.\" Other elements of the Denver underground will encounter the team, because they want to know the terms of the treaty.",
